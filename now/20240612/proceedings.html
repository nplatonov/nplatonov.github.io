<h1>Management<a href="#management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>In Russia, polar bears are managed at the state level. The Constitution of the Russian Federation, as the highest legal act, establishes prerequisites for nature preservation and the rights of residents. Federal laws, which form the second level in the hierarchy of legal acts, serve as the basis for management activities. Regulations define the procedures for enforcing these laws. Authorities implement this legislative framework to ensure effective polar bear management.</p>
<div id="legislative-basis" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Legislative Basis<a href="#legislative-basis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<div id="the-constitution" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>The Constitution<a href="#the-constitution" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Constitution of the Russian Federation occupies the highest position in the hierarchy of normative legal acts. It outlines the fundamental principles of the organization of the country’s governing bodies, the judicial system, citizens’ rights and responsibilities, and ( most relevant for environmental and wildlife protection) the principles governing the distribution of powers between the federal government and its subjects. The following articles are particularly significant for interactions between citizens and nature, including polar bears and their habitats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Article 58: Everyone is obliged to preserve nature and the environment and to take care of natural resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 42: Everyone has the right to a favorable environment, reliable information about its condition, and compensation for damage caused to health or property by environmental violations.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="federal-laws" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Federal Laws<a href="#federal-laws" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Federal laws form the second tier in the hierarchy of regulatory legal acts of the Russian Federation and constitute the primary legislative foundation. These laws apply uniformly across the entire territory of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>The management and conservation of polar bears are addressed through several federal laws:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“On Environment Protection” (2002, No. 7-FZ): This law establishes the “Red Data Book of the Russian Federation”, aimed at protecting and monitoring rare and endangered species, including polar bears.</p></li>
<li><p>“On Wildlife” (1995, No. 52-FZ): This law prohibits actions that adversely affect species listed in the Red Data Book.</p></li>
<li><p>“On Protected Areas” (1995, No. 33-FZ): This law regulates relations concerning the protection and use of specially protected natural areas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Violations of these laws are addressed under the “Criminal Code of the Russian Federation” (1996, No. 63-FZ), which safeguards the rights and freedoms of citizens while enforcing environmental and wildlife protection regulations.</p>
</div>
<div id="presidential-decrees" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Presidential Decrees<a href="#presidential-decrees" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The next level in the hierarchy includes decrees and orders issued by the President of the Russian Federation. These have direct effect across the entire country but must not contradict the Constitution or federal laws. Key presidential decrees relevant to polar bear management include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Basics of State Policy in the Field of Environmental Development: This outlines general principles for sustainable environmental development in Russia.</p></li>
<li><p>The Strategy for the Development of the Arctic Zone: As the Arctic Zone is considered critical for national security, this strategy emphasizes the need for a permanent human presence in polar bear habitats. It highlights the importance of addressing human-polar bear conflicts to ensure safety and conservation in these areas.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="regulations" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Regulations<a href="#regulations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The next significant level in the hierarchy of legal acts comprises regulations adopted by the Government of the Russian Federation (decrees and orders) and instructions issued by various ministries.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strategy for the Conservation of Rare and Endangered Animals, Plants, and Fungi: This regulation is adopted by the Government.</p></li>
<li><p>The Red Data Book of Rare and Endangered Animals of the Russian Federation: This regulation is adopted by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="new-regulations" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>New Regulations<a href="#new-regulations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>No significant new environmental regulations have been approved recently, apart from minor encouraging updates.</p>
<p>Under the previous edition of <span class="citation"><em><span>R</span>ed <span>D</span>ata <span>B</span>ook</em> (<a href="#ref-RedBook2001en">2001</a>)</span>, polar bears in Russia were classified into three distinct populations: the Kara-Barents Sea population, the Laptev Sea population, and the Alaska-Chukotka population. These population boundaries are specified, for example, in the 2010 Strategy for Polar Bear Conservation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-PB_strategy2010en">Belikov <em>et al.</em>, 2010b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Currently, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation (see the next section) uses the term “subpopulation” in its statements and official documents, aligning with IUCN definitions for consistency.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="authorities" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Authorities<a href="#authorities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Various ministries and agencies are responsible for overseeing the implementation of legal acts. These authorities have a hierarchical structure, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation:
This ministry develops state policies and legal regulations in the fields of study, use, reproduction, and protection of natural resources. It is responsible for the development and approval of new protected areas (PAs), considering both internal ministerial and external third-party justifications. Polar bears within these Arctic Zone PAs are subject to additional monitoring. The ministry also oversees the national project “Ecology”, which seeks to involve additional commercial funding (see below) for polar bear studies.</p></li>
<li><p>Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources:
This authority supervises and enforces the protection and use of flora and fauna, environmental management, and the maintenance of wild animals, including polar bears, in captivity. It approves or declines permits for the temporary removal of polar bears and their subsequent return to the wild by affiliated organisations. Additionally, it oversees ecological activities in federal and regional PAs.</p></li>
<li><p>Federal State Budgetary Institutes (FSBIs):
Under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation, there are 135 FSBIs responsible for managing 233 federal specially protected natural areas (PAs).</p></li>
<li><p>Regional Authorities:
Regional authorities are responsible for managing regional PAs, including ensuring the protection of polar bears within their jurisdictions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="implementation" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Implementation<a href="#implementation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<div id="federal-projects" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Federal Projects<a href="#federal-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>The Federal Project “Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecotourism Development”</strong> implements the objectives of the state program “Environmental Protection” and the national project “Ecology” for conserving biological diversity. This is achieved through the creation of new specially protected natural areas, reintroduction of rare animal species, and improvement of ecological tourism infrastructure. This federal project is managed by a newly established budgetary institution, “RosZapovedCenter”, under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation. “RosZapovedCenter” oversees scientific and educational activities related to the project. Additionally, it leads the “Business and Biodiversity” initiative, aimed at securing funding from commercial companies.</p>
<p>In efforts to conserve rare animals, the polar bear and 12 other species have been prioritized. A special working group has been organized to ensure the success of these conservation tasks. This group comprises 13 expert sections, each dedicated to a specific species, including the polar bear expert section. These sections focus on implementing conservation strategies and recovery programs for priority species through detailed “road maps” developed by involved experts.</p>
<p><strong>The polar bear expert section</strong> includes 22 members, among them PBSG members Anatoly Kochnev and Stanislav Belikov. The section holds regular meetings to address critical issues related to polar bear conservation and human-wildlife conflicts. Their outputs include reports and recommendations submitted to the Ministry. Special meetings are convened to make decisions on extraordinary cases.</p>
<p><strong>The Strategy for Polar Bear Conservation of the Russian Federation</strong> was adopted in 2022, replacing the previous outdated edition <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-PB_strategy2010en">Belikov <em>et al.</em>, 2010b</a>)</span>. This strategy, approved by an order of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation on 01 March 2022 (No. 7-r), outlines two stages: 2022–2024 and 2025–2030. Although the public version of the strategy is not yet available, access to the ministerial order is possible via specific state document services.</p>
<p><strong>The Action Plan for Polar Bear Conservation</strong> was also approved in 2022, superseding the previous edition <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-PB_actionplan2010en">Belikov <em>et al.</em>, 2010a</a>)</span>. Its principal objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improving legislation, regulatory legal, and methodological frameworks for polar bear conservation.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing and enhancing the system of protected areas within polar bear habitats.</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing territorial protection for polar bears outside protected areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing conflict situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Conducting scientific research and monitoring:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assessing the status of polar bear subpopulations, including population size estimates for the Barents Sea (BS), Kara Sea (KS), Laptev Sea (LV), and Chukchi Sea (CS) subpopulations.</p></li>
<li><p>Studying and forecasting the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic factors on polar bears.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Promoting ecological education.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Road Map for Polar Bear Conservation Measures</strong> closely aligns with the Action Plan but includes an emphasis on international cooperation. It also details subcontractors involved in conservation efforts. Its objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improving regulatory legal and methodological frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing and enhancing protected areas within polar bear habitats.</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing the effectiveness of polar bear conservation.</p></li>
<li><p>Preventing and resolving conflict situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring and assessing polar bear population sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting ecological education.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhancing international cooperation.</p></li>

</p>
</div>
<p>There are 52 protected areas overlapping with the IUCN polar bear subpopulation boundaries. By management level, these include: 21 with federal status, 30 with regional status, 1 with local status. By classification, these consist of: 6 state nature reserves (zapovedniks), 4 national parks, 7 federal wildlife refuges (zakazniks), 3 natural parks, 7 regional wildlife refuges, 17 natural monuments, 2 buffer zones, and 1 resting area. The alignment between Russian protected areas and IUCN categories was prepared by Boris Solovyev from Systematic Conservation Consultancy (Figure <a href="#fig:fig-epa">1</a>). According to IUCN categories, the protected areas include: 7 Strict Nature Reserves (Ia), 3 Wilderness Areas (Ib), 6 National Parks (II), 17 Natural Monuments (III), 12 Habitat/Species Management Areas (IV), and 7 Managed Resource Protected Areas (IV).</p>
<p>No new protected areas have been established during the 2022–2024 period.</p>

<div id="conservation" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Conservation<a href="#conservation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The new edition of <strong>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation</strong> was published in 2021 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-RedBook2021en"><em><span>R</span>ed <span>D</span>ata <span>B</span>ook</em>, 2021</a>)</span>. In this edition, species are categorized taxonomically, with each described in a dedicated article. The article on the polar bear was compiled by PBSG members Stanislav Belikov and Anatoly Kochnev <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-RedBook2021en-pbear">Belikov and Kochnev, 2021</a>)</span>, detailing the conservation category and status, distribution, habitat, population size, limiting factors, and required conservation actions.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous edition of <span class="citation"><em><span>R</span>ed <span>D</span>ata <span>B</span>ook</em> (<a href="#ref-RedBook2001en">2001</a>)</span>, where the unified Barents Sea (BS) and Kara Sea (KS) subpopulation had the status “4 (Uncertain)”, the Laptev Sea (LV) subpopulation was “3 (Rare)”, and the Chukchi Sea (CS) subpopulation was “5 (Rehabilitated and Rehabilitating”, polar bears are no longer segregated into subpopulations. All BS/KS/LV/CS polar bears are now assigned the status “3 (Rare)” and category “Vulnerable”. This aligns with “VU A4abd” on the IUCN Scale and “VU A3c” on the IUCN Red List. The conservation priority is categorized as “I – Highest priority for conservation action”.</p>
<p>The status “3 (Rare)” is also reflected in Regional Red Books, such as Archangelsk (2020 edition), Nenets (2006), Yamal (2010), and Krasnoyarsk (2011). The Yakutian Red Data Book (2003) assigns the status “2 (Declining Population)”, while the Chukchi region’s first edition (2008) specified “4 (Uncertain Status)”.</p>
<p>The second edition of <strong>the Red Book of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug</strong>, published in 2022, includes an article on the polar bear prepared with the participation of PBSG member Anatoly Kochnev. In this edition, the conservation status was updated to “5 – Rehabilitated and Rehabilitating” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ChukchiRedBook2022-en">Kochnev and Litovka, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Following the successful identification of a network of priority areas for conservation in the Arctic seas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Solovyev2017_MPA">Solovyev <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>)</span>, a new international pan-Arctic project, ArcNet, was launched. Numerous contributors, many from Russia, including PBSG members Stanislav Belikov, Anatoly Kochnev, and Nikita Platonov, provided spatial data on distributions, feeding and breeding areas, and other parameters for pinnipeds, cetaceans, benthos, fish, birds, and polar bears. Parameters related to sea ice and coastal zones were also included. The ArcNet framework focuses on a network of approximately 80 Priority Areas for Conservation (PACs), designed through expert-driven systematic conservation planning using conservation targets for over 800 conservation features (CFs) representing Arctic biodiversity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-James2024">James <em>et al.</em>, 2024</a>)</span>. These CFs, their targets, and the PACs were identified systematically based on their biological and ecological significance. Implementing the ArcNet PACs as a network of protected and conserved areas is expected to enhance Arctic Ocean biodiversity and support nations in meeting their UN-level commitments to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030, as outlined in the Montreal Convention on Biological Diversity in 2022.</p>
</div>
<div id="funding" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Funding<a href="#funding" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Funding for polar bear management and research comes from governmental (budgetary) and non-governmental (extrabudgetary) sources. Two principal ministries, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russuan Federation (Ministry of Nature) and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Ministry of Science), receive budgetary funding for polar bear management and research. The Ministry of Nature funds activities related to protected areas, with authorities receiving additional income from tourism or partnerships with commercial companies. The newly established “RosZapovedCenter”, while receiving budgetary funding from the Ministry of Nature, also secures extrabudgetary funds from commercial companies to support protected area authorities.
The Ministry of Science provides funding directly to research institutes and through scientific grants, which may also include non-budgetary contributions. Research institutes may additionally secure funding from commercial companies.
In recent years, some scientific funding programs have ceased to exist. For example, WWF Russia, which historically provided significant funding for polar bear research, conservation, and related projects, no longer does so. Furthermore, restrictions on foreign funding have been introduced, complicating access to external financial support.</p>

<p>Scientific research projects on polar bears are conducted by individual scientific institutions and non-governmental organizations.</p>
<p><em>Natural reserves</em> primarily manage protected areas but also play an active role in polar bear research. <strong>The Russian Arctic National Park</strong> conducts several research components, including spring surveys of maternal dens on Alexandra Land Island (Franz Josef Land archipelago) with data from expeditions by the “Severtsov Institute”, monitoring the number of polar bear encounters reported by park staff during tourist cruises, analysis of camera trap data from northern Novaya Zemlya and Alexandra Land Island. <strong>The Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve</strong>, supported by “RosZapovedCenter” in 2022, continues long-term monitoring efforts, including tracking maternal den distribution, conducting ground and aerial polar bear surveys, and analysing camera trap data. <strong>The Bear Islands State Nature Reserve</strong> is managed by <strong>the Lensky Pillars State Nature Reserve</strong>, with expanded activities into <strong>the Kurdigino Krestovaya Resource Reservation</strong>. These activities include monitoring maternal den distribution, ground and aerial polar bear surveys, and camera trap analysis. In 2023, “RosZapovedCenter” supported UAV-based aerial surveys of the Bear Islands. <strong>The Gydansky National Park</strong> focuses on estimating polar bear occurrences, with support from “RosZapovedCenter” expected in 2024. Meanwhile, <strong>The Great Arctic State Nature Reserve</strong>, managed by <strong>the Joint Directorate of Taymyr Reserves</strong>, had plans for polar bear surveys in 2024, but these were postponed. Research activities in areas managed by <strong>the Ust-Lensky State Nature Reserve</strong> and <strong>the New Siberian Islands Wildlife Refuge</strong> remain systematic but limited <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gladysheva2022en">Gladysheva, 2022</a>)</span>, primarily due to the inaccessibility of key polar bear habitats. Basic research here involves polar bear occurrence studies. The Ust-Lensky State Nature Reserve co-participated in the “Master of the Arctic” aerial survey in 2021 and plans to conduct another polar bear survey in 2025. <strong>The Beringia National Park</strong> has recently summarized polar bear distribution on terrestrial Chukotka, identified effective measures for human safety near polar bears, and continues behaviour analysis at model sites.</p>
<p><em>Research institutes</em> focus on specialized polar bear studies, leveraging multidisciplinary expertise. <strong>The All-Russian Research Institute for Environmental Protection </strong> (VNII Ecology), in collaboration with <strong>the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences</strong> (Geography Institute), has made progress in the following areas: ground surveys of polar bears on Wrangel Island (2016–2019), monitoring polar bear occurrences on sea ice, preparing methodologies for maternal den surveys, developing models of environmental suitability for maternal dens on Wrangel Island, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and Novaya Zemlya (ongoing). Their studies also include polar bear welfare in the Laptev Sea, vulnerability to climate change, and reviews of marine mammal activities in the Franz Josef Land region. <strong>The Institute of Biological Problems of the North, Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences</strong>, collaborates with <strong>the Beringia National Park</strong> on polar bear behaviour and distribution as well as human-polar bear conflict issues. <strong>The A. N. Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences</strong> (Severtsov Institute) focuses on aerial surveys (e.g., Laptev Sea in 2021), seropositivity, immunity, microbiology, toxicology, and population structure. Their data are primarily collected through captures. Between 2022 and 2024, fieldwork resulted in 75 polar bear encounters, with 12 biological samples (blood, hair, excrement, microbiology sets) collected from immobilized individuals.</p>
<p><em>Non-profit organizations</em> have recently become active participants in polar bear research, contributing valuable results. <strong>The Marine Mammals Research and Expedition Center</strong> conducts polar bear and marine mammal studies. Its activities include: supporting onshore and offshore research expeditions, providing training for personal safety in polar bear habitats, organizing and managing territorial security systems. This center has demonstrated effectiveness in necessary immobilization procedures and auditing camping safety measures. <strong>The Autonomous Non-Profit Organization “EcoFactor”</strong> develops neural network and computer vision software for polar bear identification using object detection and classification approaches. It also organizes aerial surveys for marine mammals and polar bears. As a principal subcontractor of “RosZapovedCenter”, “EcoFactor” conducted aerial surveys on Wrangel Island in 2022 and the Bear Islands in 2023.</p>

<p>The Institute of Biological Problems of the North and National Park “Beringia” compiled a database on polar bear occurrences and footprints in the Chukotka region. Their principal findings indicate that polar bear occurrences depend on sea ice conditions and food availability, with no significant evidence of dramatic changes in occurrence patterns.</p>
<p>The Gydansky National Park summarised the results of polar bear coastal registrations in the Yamal region during ice-free periods on Shokalsky Island, Yavay Peninsula, Vilkitsky Island, and Neupokoyeva Island. An increase in bear sightings was observed between 1999 and 2023, with exceptionally high numbers in 2016 and 2020. A correlation was found between the rise in polar bear detections and seasonal air temperature records from nearby meteorological stations.</p>
<p>The Ust-Lensky State Nature Reserve compiled archived data on polar bear encounters in the western Laptev Sea during 1971–2019. This data includes reports from individuals conducting non-research-related activities at specific times and locations. Encounters primarily occurred during the warm season (June to October) and were reported from polar stations, fishing sites, and other expedition camps. A total of 52 single individuals, four groups of two bears, and three groups of three bears were observed over the study period <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gladysheva2023-appendix1">Gladysheva, 2023a</a>)</span>. Notably, in 2011, eight bears passed through an expedition camp on Bennett Island in a single day. The primary outcome of this work was the systematic collection and organisation of available data for potential future statistical analysis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gladysheva2023">Gladysheva, 2023b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Yakutian Directorate of Biological Resources presented data on annual polar bear encounters in the Kurdigino Krestovaya Resource Reservation from 2005 to 2023. Annual encounters ranged from 17 to 28, with a mean value of 21.5 and a standard deviation of 3.3. No statistically significant trends were identified.</p>
<p>The Lensky Pillars State Nature Reserve conducted a ground polar bear survey in the Bear Islands area during summer 2022. Observations included six polar bears in good physical condition: one female with one cub, two single females, and two single males.</p>
<p>The Lensky Pillars State Nature Reserve also reported a database of recent polar bear inland entries south of the coastlines of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas. The most notable inland journey occurred in 2021 when a female polar bear was captured in the Dzhebariki-Khaya settlement, approximately 300 kilometres east of Yakutsk.</p>
<p>The Russian Arctic National Park conducts year-round monitoring of polar bears and recorded 103 adults and 20 cubs (COY and yearlings) in 2022, and 53 adults and 17 cubs in 2023 within the park boundaries. During a ground survey in April 2022, park staff observed 20 unique bears, including two females with two COYs each and two females with single COYs. Summer observations revealed that bears frequently move along the coastline in search of stranded marine mammals, stopping near bird colonies or walrus terrestrial haulouts. In 2022, a female with three cubs was recorded for the first time within park boundaries. Detection of mating pairs in the area remains rare, which may indicate low reproductive potential in the local polar bear group. Camera trap data revealed that polar bears persist at the northern tip of Novaya Zemlya throughout the year, either staying on the sea ice or periodically returning to shore.</p>
<p>VNII Ecology and the Geography Institute conducted shipboard and aerial (helicopter) marine mammal observations in March and April 2019 northwest of the Franz Josef Land archipelago and northeast of the Svalbard archipelago. Over 37 days of ice drift and more than 100 hours of helicopter surveys, 32 polar bears and 73 sets of tracks were recorded, including 14 old tracks and 59 fresh tracks. All observations occurred within the Barents Sea subpopulation area. One notable observation involved a female with her cub on an iceberg, surrounded by adult and COY tracks, a hole at the iceberg’s base, and a long distance to land. The timing shortly after usual den emergence suggested the presence of a maternal den <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Belikov-transarctic2019">Tyuryakov <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3>Maternal Den Surveys<a href="#maternal-den-surveys" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve has conducted maternal den surveys since its establishment. Initially, surveys relied on aerial observations and ground-based methods, but since 2020, UAVs equipped with optical and infrared cameras have also been utilised. Beginning in 2021, both fly-per-view and mission-planning modes were implemented. In mission-planning mode, flight parameters were selected to ensure unbroken image coverage of the full study area using a photo camera. A new model site was defined in 2021 in the central mountainous regions of the island. This site consists of two segments, with areas of 25 km² and 30 km², located within a system of hills cut by rivers. Parameters recorded during data collection include den georeference, footprints around the den, animal presence/absence, and the number of animals. In 2022, surveys conducted from 14 March to 10 April identified 12 maternal dens and 23 polar bear families, with litter sizes ranging from 1 to 3 cubs and an average of 1.73. In 2024, surveys conducted from 08 March to 17 April recorded 38 maternal dens and 38 polar bear families, with an average litter size of 1.76, also ranging from 1 to 3 cubs. No survey was conducted in 2023.</p>
<p>The Lensky Pillars State Nature Reserve performed maternal den surveys on the Bear Islands (East Siberian Sea) and adjacent mainland in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2022, 20 inhabited maternal dens were recorded, although the number of cubs was not determined. Ground survey routes crossed tracks from 6 family groups with one cub, 1 family group with 2 cubs, and 15 solitary individuals. Additionally, two females with 2 cubs each were visually observed. The minimum reported litter size was 1.2 due to the unknown number of cubs in dens. In 2023, 26 maternal dens were identified, including 14 inhabited dens. Tracks of 5 family groups and 17 solitary individuals were recorded. Visual observations included 4 females with 2 cubs each and one single polar bear. Overall, 30 females and 41 cubs of the year (COYs) were counted, with an average litter size of 1.36.</p>
<p>The Russian Arctic National Park continues ground-based surveys of maternal dens on Alexandra Land Island in the Franz Josef Land archipelago. Surveys were not conducted in 2023. Four maternal dens were identified in 2022, and two were recorded in 2024. Females with cubs typically begin emerging from dens on Franz Josef Land in mid-March. Based on five surveys conducted over the last seven years, the understanding of suitable denning locations on Alexandra Land Island has been significantly expanded.</p>

<h3>Maternal Dens Modelling<a href="#maternal-dens-modelling" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>VNII Ecology and the Geography Institute have developed generalised principles for identifying areas potentially suitable for denning by breeding female polar bears. To pinpoint such areas, the Habitat Suitability Modelling method was employed. This approach combines statistical data on the locations of known dens with analyses of environmental conditions required for den construction. The list of necessary habitat conditions and their degrees of suitability were derived from previous research. Using a landscape approach and GIS technologies, this method allows researchers to map areas suitable for denning and assess the suitability of different parts of Arctic islands and archipelagos. This research began in 2019 with a focus on Wrangel Island and has since expanded to core denning areas in the Russian sector of the Arctic, including Wrangel Island and the coastal areas of the Chukchi Peninsula (with mainland areas verified by retrospective aerial surveys) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Belikov-denWrangel">Melikhova <em>et al.</em>, 2022</a>)</span>. For the Franz Josef Land archipelago, Alexandra Land Island and Graham Bell Island were identified as the most suitable areas due to their coastal topography, which supports favourable snow accumulation conditions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Belikov-denFJL">Gnedenko <em>et al.</em>, 2022</a>)</span>. In the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago, Bolshevik Island was determined to be the most suitable site for denning, due to its extensive slopes and valleys conducive to snow accumulation and its relatively low glacier coverage <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Belikov-denSevZemlya">Belikov <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>)</span>. Ongoing research is currently focused on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.</p>

<h3>Maternal Dens Survey Methodology<a href="#maternal-dens-survey-methodology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>VNII Ecology and the Geography Institute have developed methodologies and approaches for polar bear den surveys using Wrangel Island and Herald Island as model sites <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Belikov-denMetodology">Belikov <em>et al.</em>, 2022b</a>)</span>. Three primary approaches are employed: ground surveys, aerial surveys, and hybrid surveys. Ground Surveys: These surveys involve direct observation of dens on the ground, with model sites selected to represent multiple environmental strata. Aerial Surveys: These surveys allow for the broader coverage of denning areas and are used in combination with model sites to verify results. Surveys are conducted at several intervals during the den abandonment period. Hybrid Surveys: This approach combines aerial and ground surveys. Ground surveys are used exclusively on model sites to verify aerial survey data and minimise errors or underestimates. Model sites are essential for extrapolating results, as they allow researchers to stratify environmental data. Stratification from <span class="citation">Melikhova <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-Belikov-denWrangel">2022</a>)</span> have been used to generalise findings for whole Wrangel Island. The repeatability of aerial surveys depends on the density of open dens within each stratum. If den density is consistent across strata, a single day of aerial surveying at the peak of the den abandonment season is sufficient for extrapolating hybrid survey results. For Herald Island, an absolute aerial survey during the peak den abandonment period is recommended to ensure the accuracy of data.</p>

<div id="observational-surveys" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Observational Surveys<a href="#observational-surveys" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>VNII Ecology and the Geography Institute, in collaboration with the Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve, the University of Washington, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Polar Bear International, conducted annual ground observational surveys from 2016 to 2019 during the September–October open water period in the waters around Wrangel Island <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Regehr2023">Regehr <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>)</span>. The total length of routes covered approximately 1,000 km each year. Survey routes were designed to traverse key polar bear habitats, including shorelines, spits, riverbeds, tundra, hills, and mountains. For each bear or family group observed, detailed information was recorded. Polar bear observations included: 179 individuals in 2016, 589 individuals in 2017, 466 individuals in 2018, 367 individuals in 2019. It is important to note that these figures do not represent the total number of polar bears on Wrangel Island. By age and sex composition, the observations were as follows: 28% were single males, 12% were single females, 29% were females with cub(s), 5% were subadults, 26% were of unknown sex and age.
In terms of Body Condition Index: 34% of bears scored 4 or 5, 63% scored 3, 3% scored 1 or 2.
The average litter size for COYs was 1.61, and for yearlings, 1.51. A comparison with 2005–2009 suggests that litter sizes were similar between the two periods.</p>
<p>The Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve continued this work in 2023 using the same protocol for ground surveys <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Regehr2023">Regehr <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>)</span>. Over 14 routes covering 540 kilometers between 04–29 September, 266 polar bear individuals were observed. By habitat type: 69% of bears were on slopes, 17% in tundra, 12% on banks, 2% near rivers. By observed behaviour: 52% were resting, 34% were walking, 6% were standing still, 4% were sitting, 3% were running, 1% were sleeping. By age and sex composition: 41.2% were single adults of undefined sex, 29.8% were singles of undefined age and sex, 7.8% were single adult males, 6.0% were single adult females, 4.1% were adult females with two COYs, 2.8% were adult females with one COY, 2.8% were adult females with one cub of undefined age, 2.3% were adult females with two cubs of undefined age,
1.4% were adult females with two yearlings, 0.9% were adult females with one yearling, 0.5% were single subadults of unknown sex, 0.5% were single yearlings of unknown sex. Among the 15 families with COYs, the average litter size was 1.6, while the five families with yearlings had an average litter size of 1.4. In terms of Body Condition Index, 27% of polar bears scored 3, and 8% scored 4. Although brown bears are present on the island, no interactions between brown bears and polar bears have been observed to date.</p>
<p>Severtsov Institute and Ust-Lensky State Nature Reserve, with assistance from the ecological foundation “Clean Seas”, conducted a polar bear aerial survey in the eastern Laptev Sea as part of the “Master of the Arctic - 2021” project. This survey utilised both observational and instrumental techniques, with equipment operating in both infrared and optical bands. Over eight flight days between 21 May and 06 June, a total of 11,000 kilometers were covered during 43 hours of flight along eight routes. The survey encountered 22 polar bear individuals across 12 sightings and identified 86 polar bear tracks.</p>
<p>The Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve, with technical assistance from the non-profit organization “EcoFactor”, carried out an instrumental aerial survey of polar bear distribution under the “Polar Bear Census” project by “RosZapovedCenter” in 2022. The survey design included a unit of three UAVs, “Orlan-10”, operating in the following modes: all three UAVs surveying simultaneously, or two UAVs surveying while the third served as a relay between the operator and UAVs at long distances. The “Orlan-10” UAVs provided coverage of up to 1,000 kilometers per flight, with a duration of 12 hours at altitudes ranging from 200 to 5,000 meters. Survey transects were designed as equidistant and parallel to ensure comprehensive image acquisition in the visible spectrum, with 5–10% cross-overlap between serial images. The photo images had a resolution with a cell size of 2–7 cm, and georeference accuracy ranged from 3–8 cm. Four model sites were selected for the survey, with each site covering 10–20% of the total area. Verification was conducted using ground surveys on a small reference site that had been fully covered by aerial survey. The survey was divided into two phases: 30 August to 06 September used for polar bear distribution reconnaissance and setup, and 08 to 16 September used for data collection, including one survey along the coastline outside the model sites. Over 17 survey flights covering 8,300 kilometers, 23,000 images were captured. A total of 506 polar bears were observed, including 135 along the coastline. The number of polar bears on model sites was adjusted to 729 using the Chelintsev methodology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Chelintsev_en">Chelintsev, 2000</a>)</span>. No adjustment was made for the coastal survey results. The estimated total number of polar bears on Wrangel Island was calculated to be 864.</p>
<p>The State Lensky Pillars Reserve and Severtsov Institute conducted a single-day helicopter aerial survey of all islands in the Bear Islands archipelago and the adjacent mainland coastline in early October 2022. A total of 66 polar bears were observed, all of which were reported to be in good body condition.</p>
<p>The Lensky Pillars State Nature Reserve, with technical assistance from the non-profit organization “EcoFactor”, also conducted an instrumental aerial survey of the Bear Islands archipelago (excluding the easternmost island) and the adjacent mainland coastline in early October 2023 under the “Polar Bear Census” project by “RosZapovedCenter”. A single “Orlan-10” UAV was used, covering 2,700 kilometers of survey routes. More than 25,000 aerial images were acquired, which were processed using neural network detection. The training dataset for the neural network consisted of data from the 2016 aerial survey (“CheSS Project” in the Chukchi Sea) and the 2022 survey (“Polar Bear Census” on Wrangel Island). A total of 176 polar bears were identified. This survey marked the first application of express processing for a large volume of aerial polar bear data in field conditions using neural networks, demonstrating the methodology’s efficiency and potential for future use.</p>

<div id="behaviour" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Behaviour<a href="#behaviour" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Institute of Biological Problems of the North and the Beringia National Park continued monitoring the autumn concentrations of polar bears near coastal walrus haulouts along the Chukotka coast from 2022 to 2024. The research involved collecting field data on the number, demographics, diet, fatness, and behaviour of polar bears.</p>
<p>Following the summer and autumn sea ice breakup, polar bears remaining along the Chukchi coast frequently visited the vicinity of walrus terrestrial haulouts. The primary observation points were at Cape Schmidt, Cape Vankarem, and Sertse-Kamen on the Chukchi Sea coast. Drones were utilised to assess the abundance and age and sex composition of local polar bear aggregations.</p>
<p>Polar bears formed the most consistent aggregations at Kozhevnikov Cliff (Cape Schmidt). Despite the absence of a large food source, such as walrus carcasses in the coastal rookery over the past three years, polar bears continued to visit the area. However, they no longer formed stable, long-term groups, and their distribution along the coast was more dispersed. Encounters with populated areas have become more frequent, making villages like Ryrkaipy and Cape Schmidt problematic areas for human-polar bear interactions. These trends must be considered in planning and implementing economic activities in the region.</p>
</div>
<div id="seropositivity" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Seropositivity<a href="#seropositivity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Severtsov Institute analysed the seropositivity of polar bears from the Barents Sea subpopulation to various pathogens, including canine distemper virus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus, Toxoplasma, Trichinella (<em>Trichinella sp.</em>), Mycoplasma (<em>Mycoplasma sp.</em>), Candida (<em>Candida sp.</em>), and Chlamydia (<em>Chlamydia sp.</em>) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Naidenko2023_en">Naidenko <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>)</span>. Ten polar bears were captured from northern Novaya Zemlya Archipelago and another ten from Alexandra Land Island in the Franz Josef Land archipelago. The results were compared with a similar study conducted ten years earlier <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Naidenko2013_en">Naidenko <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>)</span>. All animals tested seronegative for Toxoplasma, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Candida, herpes simplex virus, and parvovirus. Five animals were seropositive for canine distemper virus: two from Franz Josef Land and three from Novaya Zemlya. Additionally, five animals had questionable serum reactions: two from Franz Josef Land and three from Novaya Zemlya. The overall proportion of animals with seropositive and questionable reactions was 40% for Franz Josef Land and 60% for Novaya Zemlya, resulting in a general proportion of 50%. Regarding Trichinella, 18 animals tested seropositive, while the two seronegative animals from Novaya Zemlya were immature (ages 0.5 and 1.5 years). The seropositive rate for Trichinella on Franz Josef Land was 100%. Over the past decade, an increased proportion of animals seropositive for Trichinella and canine distemper virus has been observed in the Barents Sea region. This trend may be linked to changes in pathogen prevalence in natural ecosystems, epizootics among prey species, and increased contact between polar bears on land.</p>

<div id="immunity" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Immunity<a href="#immunity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Severtsov Institute conducted immunological studies on polar bears, focusing on three key immunity parameters. The total amount of natural antibodies was assessed using a test involving non-replicated antigens, specifically sheep red blood cells. Levels were found to be extremely low in zoo-kept polar bears, presumably due to an inadequate diet, and low in wild bears from Franz Josef Land. The relationship between these findings and infectious disease susceptibility is not yet understood. Lysozyme Concentration (antibacterial protein) was found to be very low in adult polar bears from Novaya Zemlya and in juveniles. The activity of the complement system, a key component of innate immunity, was very low across all populations studied. This suggests that this component of immunity may be poorly developed in polar bears.</p>
</div>
<div id="microbiology" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Microbiology<a href="#microbiology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Severtsov Institute conducted microbiological research on polar bear samples collected between 2019 and 2021. For the first time, bacterial and fungal communities in the intestines of polar bears from the Barents and Kara Seas subpopulations were compared based on diet: natural food versus human food (waste products). The study tested the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiome and metabolism of polar bears may change as they increasingly consume atypical food sources due to climate change and the extended ice-free periods in the Arctic, which force them to stay onshore and visit human-populated areas. The results showed that feeding on human waste does not cause signs of dysbiosis but likely leads to adaptive changes in the bacterial microbiome. However, the emergence of fungal facultative pathogens poses an increased risk of infections <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Vechersky2023">Vecherskii <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="toxicology" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Toxicology<a href="#toxicology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Severtsov Institute conducted toxicological analyses of polar bear samples. In 2020 and 2021, the total concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the blood of polar bears from Novaya Zemlya were found to be extremely high. While PCB concentrations in bears from Franz Josef Land were higher than most other studies, they were within the general range of values. By comparison, PCB levels in animals from Novaya Zemlya were at least twice as high as those in other Arctic regions. The average mercury concentration in bear hair samples was 2.4 ± 1.5 μg/g, with no observed differences between Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land. This is well below the toxic threshold, suggesting that mercury is not a health risk for bears in these regions. These findings align with the conclusion that mercury levels in polar bears in the Arctic seas of Svalbard and Russia are among the lowest in the Arctic <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lippold2022_mercury">Lippold <em>et al.</em>, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="population-structure" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Population Structure<a href="#population-structure" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Severtsov Institute analysed the genetic structure of the polar bear population in the western sector of the Russian Arctic using samples collected from 2010 to 2021. The study examined polymorphism in 17 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci and a 610-nucleotide-long mtDNA D-loop fragment in 93 adult individuals. The results revealed that polar bears from the northern Barents and Kara Seas are genetically homogeneous. However, bears from the southeastern Barents Sea displayed marked differences in mtDNA markers, with only weak differentiation observed in microsatellites. This indicates the existence of a small, relatively isolated group of polar bears inhabiting Yuzhny Island in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, which is supported by telemetry data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Sorokin2023en">Sorokin <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>VNII Ecology and the Geography Institute applied an ecosystem approach to monitoring marine mammals in the Laptev Sea and provided conclusions and recommendations for the Russian Arctic.
Habitat changes negatively impact marine mammals and polar bears across the Arctic.
Reduced prey availability forces polar bears to increase walking activity, resulting in higher energy expenditure that cannot be replenished due to limited food resources.
Warming accelerates the destruction of maternal dens before normal den emergence, posing additional challenges for polar bear survival. Increasing conflicts between polar bears and humans are linked to insufficient prey resources <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Belikov-laptev">Belikov <em>et al.</em>, 2021a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>VNII Ecology and the Geography Institute examined how environmental conditions around the Franz Josef Land archipelago affect marine mammal species. The study confirmed that young walruses are a key prey for polar bears in the fall. Based on recent occasional surveys, polar bear linear density (animals per kilometer of transect) was found to be lower than estimates used by <span class="citation">Aars <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-Aars2009">2009</a>)</span>, suggesting that the total population size for Svalbard and Franz Josef Land may be fewer than 1,000 individuals <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Belikov-FJL">Belikov <em>et al.</em>, 2021b</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The Institute of Biological Problems of the North and the Beringia National Park, in collaboration with an international group, analysed polar bear-human incidents involving the use of bear spray on free-ranging polar bears. The study found that bear spray was an effective deterrent in close-range encounters, successfully stopping undesirable behaviour in 18 of 19 incidents. Bear spray effectively deterred both curious and aggressive polar bears, including those attempting to attack humans <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Wilder2022">Wilder <em>et al.</em>, 2022</a>)</span>. However, the transportation of bear spray on airplanes is prohibited by Russia’s TSA, limiting its use to short-term activities such as fieldwork preparation.</p>
<p>In July 2020, the Marine Mammals Research and Expedition Center audited a volunteer camp on the west coast of the Yamal Peninsula. The camp was found to be organised adequately for territorial safety, with all-around views and episodic blind slopes. However, the personnel (volunteers) lacked proper training and experience in polar bear control. Instances of bear baiting, a gross safety violation, were observed, posing a significant risk of tragic consequences. The audit recommended stricter selection and thorough training for candidates participating in such work.</p>

<div id="captures" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Captures<a href="#captures" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media does not allow the use of foreign-made radio transmitters. Only domestic “Es-Pas” equipment is used for Argos and Argos+GPS telemetry. Mass-produced collars are available for various species, including female polar bears. Glue tags are also mass-produced but are not used regularly due to their short operating time. Polar bear ear tags are currently in the testing phase on wild animals.</p>
<p>During 2022–2024, only three polar bears were captured for research purposes by specialists from the Severtsov Institute. In October 2022, an Argos collar was fitted on a single female with a very high Body Condition Index on the Bear Islands. As expected, the collar dropped off after a short period. In October 2023, an adult male was captured on Bely Island, north of the Yamal Peninsula, but no transmitter was fitted. In April 2024, another adult male was captured on Alexandra Land in the Franz Josef Land archipelago, also without fitting a transmitter.</p>
<p>In December 2021 and January 2022, the Marine Mammals Research and Expedition Center carried out the removal of two orphaned COYs near a large settlement of gas workers on the western coast of the Yamal Peninsula. The cubs, both males weighing 75 kg each, were sedated, marked with glue tags, and flown 100 km north for release into the wild. After 18 days, the cubs returned to the settlement. They were re-tagged and relocated 350 km northeast to the Gydan Peninsula. The remaining 10- and 17-day tag data indicated that the cubs moved together toward sea ice with favourable conditions for seals.</p>

<h2>New Methods<a href="#new-methods" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>An initiative for citizen science aimed at involving new participants in data collection is being increasingly implemented. The vast distances between sample collection regions and processing locations in Russia pose logistical challenges, making field work expensive. This has driven the need for enhanced national scientific cooperation, particularly for sample exchange.</p>
<p>Camera traps are being used more actively, yielding notable results in areas such as the Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve, Russian Arctic National Park (on both the Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya archipelagos), and the Kurdigino-Krestovaya Resource Reservation.</p>
<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are extensively used for observational surveys (Wrangel Island, Bear Islands) and maternal den surveys (Wrangel Island). Mission planner control is crucial for long-distance and repeatable surveys, while manual control is required for real-time decision-making in response to changing weather or environmental conditions. FPV (First-Person View) control is employed for behavioural studies (e.g., at Cape Schmidt). The design phase for UAV-based capture and biopsy sampling is underway.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilised for detecting polar bears in aerial survey photos. This effort fosters collaboration between IT specialists and biologists. Current approaches predominantly use detection and segmentation neural networks, often incorporating other polar animals to improve specificity. However, the limited sample size for training datasets and high false positive/negative error rates, caused by the low contrast between objects and backgrounds, remain challenges. Backend development also remains expensive.</p>

<div id="popularization" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Popularization<a href="#popularization" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Popularising science is vital for engaging youth with Arctic research, generating public support, and building future capacity in science.</p>
<p>The international “Polar Bear Universe” conference has been held annually since 2017. In 2018, it was combined with the meeting of the Scientific Working Group associated with the 10th meeting of the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission for implementation of the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Agreement. Over time, the conference has expanded its scope, from polar bears to Arctic ecosystems, and its scale, transitioning from being hosted by the Department of Natural Resources and Ecology of Chukotka to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation. The format has also evolved from face-to-face to hybrid.</p>
<p>After the decline of the biannual “Marine Mammals of the Holarctic” international conference, a strong section dedicated to marine mammals emerged within the annual “Marine Research and Education (MARESEDU)” international conference, attracting high-level professionals.</p>
<p>The “Floating University” is a scientific and educational program that draws students to marine science, offering them hands-on training through research. This initiative not only helps participants launch their careers as ocean scientists or biologists but also enables scientists to mentor motivated students and assists organizations in addressing staff shortages in marine-related sciences. Multiple voyages are conducted in the Arctic each year as part of this program.</p>
<p>The “Clean Seas” Foundation organized a mobile exhibition, “Vacation in the Arctic”, to complement its support for scientific aerial surveys. This exhibition bus features interactive displays on polar culture, nature, and science.</p>
<p>Russian polar bear scientists deliver lectures at affiliated universities and serve as invited speakers at various events, promoting Arctic science to broader audiences.</p>
</div>
<div id="international-cooperation" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>International Cooperation<a href="#international-cooperation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>International agreements such as the Circumpolar Action Plan on Polar Bear Conservation, adopted by the Polar Bear Range States, remain indispensable for international cooperation in managing and mitigating impacts on polar bears and their ecosystems. Other active agreements include the Norway-Russia Working Group focused on researching the Barents Sea polar bear subpopulation, the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission for coordinating conservation and research activities related to the Alaska-Chukotka polar bear population (IUCN Chukchi Sea polar bear subpopulation). Despite these agreements being active, most remain in an idle status due to the cessation of international communication between U.S. and Russian governmental organizations. International coauthoring, particularly with specified affiliations, is also restricted. However, private communication between researchers continues.</p>
