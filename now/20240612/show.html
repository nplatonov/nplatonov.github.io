Good morning .bold[Amalie, Heli, Jasmine, Karyn, Lily, Kristin] and gentlemen!

My name is Nikita Platonov. Stas Belikov delegated to my organization collecting data from different entities and preparing national report about Russian updates in polar bear management and research. All Russian PBSG members contributed to this report. Before I continue, I want to honor Ian Stirling, who turned out to be an epoch in polar bear research and left a legacy of scientific publications and books, even in Russia.

----



Let's start from map with north pole sighting from central Russia

Russian territories and adjusted aquatories cross with boundaries of 4 PB subopulation: BS, KS, LV, CS. Western, BS, is shared with Norway. Eastern, CS, is shared with United States. Bilateral studies of these outer populations are possible both in collaboration and independently. It is the responsibility of Russia to study the internal subpopulations.

All Russian sipop belong to "Divergent ice" ecoregion.

According to the Status Table as revised on October 2023, population size is unknown of Kara and Laptes seas. For BS population size is about 2600 with reference to 2004. For CS population size is about 3000 with reference to 2016.

Distance sampling was used to estimate population size in the Barents sea, and capture-recapture with density extrapolation method was used for population size estimation in the Chukchi Sea. Hope, in Friday Peter Boveng will provide independent assessment after ChESS project.

It is considered, that long-term change in subpopulation size is positive for BS. Statements for other ones are impossible due to data defitient.

For short-term period during one generation length both outer subpopulations are likely stable. No enough data for statements about inner subpopulations.

Sea ice metrics such as trends in date of the spring advance and in date of the fall advance as well as changing of the summer sea ice area are great for all subpopulation. Phenological chages are more crusial for BS. Summer sea ice retreat is more significant for CS.

Under the [Red Data Book](#redbook) ([Red Book, 2001](#bib)), polar bears in Russia are segregated
into three different populations: Kara-Barents Sea population, Laptev Sea population, Alaska-Chukotka population.

The amount of finging for polar bear work has never been huge

Goverment provides budgetary component to support institutional minimalistic activity.

We have had more losses than gains lately.

We lost WWF Russia

We cannot get funding from foreign companies, so, we lost any international branches of World Wildlife Fund. WWF has been doing a lot of polar bear research in Russia.

Some national scientific foundation are ceased, disappeared.

RosZapovedCenter has been appeared, in green, increased funding for some natural reserves

As mentioned previously, protected areas in Russia are an effective tool for polar bear conservation

This map illustrates relation between Russian protected areas and polar bear subpopulation

IUCN Category is used for color bar here.

| Ia  | Strict nature reserve |
| Ib  | Wilderness area |
| II  | National park |
| III | Natural monument |
| IV  | Habitat/species management area |
| V   | Protected landscape/seascape |
| VI  | Managed resource protected area |

Another classification criterium is administrative level: federal, regional or local.

There is a large scale in square kilometers, not all reserves can be recognized on general map. Let's switch to intercative map. 






Protected areas are managed by special authorities. Some of them will be reviewed later in the context of polar bear researches.

ArcNet is a network design framework to help achieve ocean-scale, area-based marine conservation in the Arctic. The framework is centred around a network of 83 priority areas for conservation (PACs) designed through expert-driven systematic conservation planning using conservation targets for over 800 conservation features (CFs) that represent Arctic biodiversity. These CFs, their targets, and PACs were identified systematically based on their biological and ecological significance; therefore, implementing the ArcNet PACs as a network of protected and conserved areas will strengthen the Arctic Ocean’s biodiversity and help nations deliver on their UN-level commitments to protect 30% of oceans by 2030 <a name=cite-CBD2022></a>([Convention on Biological Diversity, 2022](#bib)).

Regarding to polar bear conservation the ArcNet project should be mentioned. There were many data contributors, especially from Russia, who provied spatial data of distributions, feeding and breeding area and many other parameters for pinnipeds, cetacens, benthos, fihhes, birds, polar bear. Parameters of sea ice and coastal zones are also included. Based on weights and targets there was defined the network of 83 priority areas for conservation. Results are published in the early 2024.

Polar bears continue to actively use terrestrial habitats on the capes and islands of the coastal part of the Chukchi Sea in the summer-autumn period

Even after a three-year absence of walruses, polar bears continue to visit Cape Schmidt and its environs, although they have ceased to form stable long-term groups

Despite the dispersed distribution along the coast, polar bear visits to populated areas have become more frequent

The villages of Ryrkaypiy and Cape Schmidt retain the status of a “hot spot” in the relationship between people and predators, which must be taken into account during the implementation and when planning the development of any economic activity

An activity of the system of complement. 

It was very low in all populations. Probably this component of immunity is poor developed in polar bears.

The hypothesis that intestinal microbiome
and metabolism may change as a result of the bears
using new food items that are not typical for them due
to climate change and an increase in the ice-free
period in the Arctic, which is why they more often
remain on the shore and visit human-populated areas.

Feeding on human waste does not cause any signs of dysbiosis and probably leads to
adaptive changes in the bacterial microbiome.

Emergence of fungal facultative pathogens increases the risk of infections.

Polar bears from the northern part of the Barents and Kara Seas were genetically
homogeneous.

Bears from the southeastern part of the Barents Sea differed markedly in
mtDNA markers, while only weak differentiation was observed in microsatellites.

We assume that a small and rather isolated group of polar bears inhabits the Yuzhny Island
area, which is confirmed by telemetry data.

On the topic of polar bear conservation, the VNII Ecology, represented by PBSG member Stas Belikov, and the Institute of Geography did several reseaches and published their reviews and conclusion in Russian scientific and practical journal "Environmental protection and Conservation".

Authors applied ecosystem approach to monitoring marine mammals the Laptev Sea and gave some conclusion and recommendations for the Russian Arctic.

 .header[Laptev Sea]

+ Habitat changes has a negative impact to marine mammals and polar bear.

+ In the case of reducing of prey availability the walk activity is increased, and this leads to raising of energy lost, and energy balance cannot be replenished by prey lack

+ Warming favours the destruction of maternal dens earlier than normal emergence from dens.

+ And lastly, increasing cases of conflicts between polar bears and human are due to insufficiently prey resources.
