<p><em>Schematic water circulation patterns and geographical place names in the Arctic Basin. Adopted from Rudels (2019). Dashed yellow line marks the studied region.</em></p>
<p>The region lies in the Canada Basin, to the northwest from Banks Island. Hydrography of the region is determined by the topography of the Basin, as well as sea ice and Transpolar Drift, characteristics and dynamics of the Arctic Surface Water and Arctic Deep Water, the advection of Atlantic and Pacific waters, atmospheric forcing, and river and ice runoff into the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>Large scale atmospheric forcing dominates the pressure field and govern the winds across the Arctic, which, in turn, drive the movement of the surface layers and the ice cover (e.g. Rudels et al., 2019). Over the Canada Basin, the Beaufort Gyre and the Transpolar Drift largely influence the general circulation of the surface waters and sea ice. Predominantly anticyclonic atmospheric circulation over the Amerasian Basin creates a convergence and accumulation of the surface layer water in the Canada Basin, the Beaufort Gyre, and the resulting pressure field and geostrophic circulation extends at least down to 300–400 m depth (Rudels, 2019). Over the Eurasian Basin the circulation is mostly cyclonic, influenced by low pressure systems moving from the North Atlantic through the Nordic Seas to the Arctic Ocean. Fresh surface waters are added into the Siberian Branch of the Transpolar Drift, which advects sea ice across the central Arctic Basin to the Fram Strait with mean speeds can be about ~10 km per day (e.g. Hunkins, 1990). As such, surface Polar Mixed Layer (PML) is comprised of the fresh and cold Arctic Surface Water (or Polar Surface Water), formed by the river runoff and ice melt. Surface layer can have wide range of temperatures – from the freezing temperature of -1.8 to 5 – 6 &#x00BA;C in bay and fjords, salinity from &lt;31 up to 34.4 and thickness from 20 to 75 m (e.g. Muench, 1970; Bailey, 1957; Rudels, 2019; Lien &amp; Trofimov, 2013).</p>
<p>Surface mixed layer is underlaid by a halocline layer everywhere in the Arctic Basin, except for Nansen Basin, where the halocline and the thermocline coincide (e.g. Aagaard et al., 1981; Shimada et al., 2005; Rudels, 2019). The vertical mixing that happens during wintertime is crucial for bringing the nutrients up to the surface for the development of spring blooms. Winter convection often reaches the bottom on the shelf, however in the deep Arctic basin it is not possible due to large salinity gradients. There freezing of the ice causes brine rejection, which in turn aggregates underneath the ice forming the halocline. Halocline is also created by advection from the shelves and from neighboring basins. Halocline prevents the heat from underlaying Atlantic water reach the surface (e.g. Loeng 1991; Hunkins, 1990), however, in certain regions the ocean heat can penetrate to the surface and induce sea ice melting (Wang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Deeper currents in the Arctic are in general steered by topography of the basin, comprising a large-scale cyclonic boundary current system (see the map; e.g. Rudels, 2019). Multiple branches of Atlantic Water (AW; <em>T&gt;0°C, S&gt;34.75</em>; Lien &amp; Trofimov, 2013) enter the Arctic Basin: AW from the Norwegian Atlantic Current in the Norwegian Sea bifurcates into two branches at the entrance to the Barents Sea – one flows to the north through the Fram Strait and around the Yermak Plateu (<em>T&gt;0°C, 34.75&lt;S&lt;34.9</em>; known as West Spitzbergen Current (WSC) or Fram Strait Branch Water – FSBW; Lien &amp; Trofimov, 2013), another turns east onto the Barents Shelf (the North Cape Current – NCaC, also known as Nordkapp Current or Barents Sea Branch Water – BSBW; e.g., Zubov, 1933; Ingvaldsen, 2005) and flows into the Arctic Basin through the St. Anna Trough. After circulating around the Yermak Plateau, the Yermak Branch AW either turns eastwards and eventually joins the main branch at the continental slope, or curves cyclonically westward and then southward, as Return Atlantic Current (RAC; Paquette et al. 1985; Aagaard and Coachman 1968; Bourke et al. 1988), carrying Re-circulating Atlantic Water back through Fram Strait (e.g. Rudels et al., 2002).</p>
<p>As it flows eastwards from the Fram Strait along the continental slope (about 100 – 750 m depth; e.g. Rudels et al., 1994; Rudels, 2019), AW subducts below the cold halocline layer and forms a subsurface temperature and salinity maximum (the latter is not present in the other basins). Characteristics of the inflowing into the Arctic Basin AW vary on both seasonal and decadal scales. For example, Loeng (1991) has described the inflow of Atlantic water into the Barents Sea between Bear Island and Norwegian coast to be 3.5 – 6.5 °C, with salinity greater than 35. In the Nansen Basin the Atlantic water temperature maximum generally ranges between 2 and 3 &#x00BA;C (Rudels, 2019). On its way from the Fram Strait and Eurasian Basin towards Pacific Arctic – beyond the Gakkel Ridge – AW is modified and cooled, due to mixing with ambient waters, e.g. due to incorporation of cold shelf water plumes (e.g. Nikolopoulos et al., 2009; Brugler et al., 2014; Pisareva et al., 2015; Rudels et al., 2019). Some of the AW can enter the Eurasian shelf from the north through submarine valleys and canyons (e.g. Matishov et al. 2009; Loeng et al. 1993; Schauer, Loeng et al. 2002; Lien &amp; Trofimov, 2013). AW can bring nutrients and zooplankton to the shelf via upwelling through the troughs. North of the Laptev Sea a large part of the Fram Strait branch appears to leave the slope and recirculate along the Gakkel Ridge towards Fram Strait. The rest continues to make its way to the Lomonosov Ridge, where another splitting occurs – some AW proceeds along the ridge towards Greenland, while the rest, mainly comprising Barents Sea branch water, crosses the ridge to circulate cyclonically in the Amerasian Basin. Some AW circulates in a closed gyre in the Makarov Basin (cyclonically along the Mendeleev and Alpha ridges), from where parts of it can pass through gaps in the Lomonosov Ridge to the Amundsen Basin side and flow along the ridge back towards Greenland and rejoins the boundary current. A part of the Barents Sea branch is thought to recirculate back towards Fram Strait along the northern slope of Gakkel Ridge as well (e.g. Rudels, 2019). AW later is divided again at the Chukchi Plateau (also known as Chukchi Cap), where part of the current continues along the slope south of the Cap, while another part circulates around the Cap into the Canada Basin. After circulating counterclockwise along topographic slopes in the Arctic Ocean, Atlantic waters exit the Basin through the western side of the Fram Strait (with East Greenland Current).</p>
<p>Polar Deep Water (PDW) lies beneath Atlantic Water (beneath the lower 0°C isotherm) at 600 – 700 m. PDW has almost uniform salinity (S=~34.94; e.g. Hunkins, 1990), while the temperature slightly decreases with depth down to 2000 m and slightly increases deeper than 2000 m at the adiabatic gradient (Aagaard et a1., 1985b; Hunkins, 1990). PDW forms as a result of mixing of AW and cold and saline Winter Water from the shelves, as well as advection from the Fram Strait, and occupies more than half of the volume of the Arctic Basin. In the central Arctic Ocean itself strong salinity stratification near the surface prevents the formation of deep water (Hunkins, 1990). Various modes of Polar Deep Water are known to exist in the Arctic: Eurasian Basin Deep Water in the Eurasian Basin, Canadian Basin Deep Water (CBDW) in the Canadian Basin (but also includes EBDW), Nordic Deep Water (NDW) in the Nordic Seas (including Greenland, Iceland, Norwegian Seas deep waters; e.g. Rudels et al., 2002). Due to the presence of ridges in the Basin, there is little exchange of the deep waters between the Amerasian and Eurasian basins. Eddy formation and shedding in all the mentioned water masses enhance vertical mixing of the water column, especially in the shelf regions (Rudels, 2019). In general, the deep layer is homogenous, except for the warmer and well mixed bottom layer in some regions, caused by the geothermal heating and stirring by convection from below. Submarine hydrothermal venting along mid-ocean ridges influences the hydrographic structure of the surrounding waters, contributing heat and mass fluxes from the Earth’s crust and mantle, and has important implications for the marine life, providing habitats for the vent-endemic organisms. High-temperature venting on the sea floor warms plumes which ascend through the water column, until they reach a level of neutral buoyancy (supposedly hundreds of meters above the seabed), mixing with ambient waters on their way up (Edmonds et al., 2003).</p>
<p>The climate change over the last decades has resulted in the dramatic sea-ice loss in the Arctic (e.g. in 2007 and 2012; Polyakov et al., 2017). Climatic variations in the Arctic seas and Arctic Basin highly depend on the activity and properties of the inflowing Atlantic Water (Ingvaldsen, 2005), especially while stratification is weakened and vertical mixing subsequently increased. Subsequent “Atlantification” (which is “the northward movement of sea ice in the Barents Sea, with attendant reductions in stratification, increased vertical mixing, and altered primary production”; Polyakov et al., 2017) will have dramatic effects on other geophysical and biogeochemical components of the Arctic Ocean system, e.g. enhance nutrient supply and primary production, alter freshwater storage, intensify shelf-basin exchange.</p>
