<p><em>Schematic water circulation patterns and geographical place names in the Arctic Basin region. Adopted from Rudels (2019). Dashed yellow line marks the studied region.</em></p>
<p>Hydrography of the region is determined by the topography of the Canada Basin and the abyssal mountains in the Stefansson Basin, as well as the sea ice and Transpolar Drift, characteristics and dynamics of the Arctic Surface Water and Arctic Deep Water, the advection of Atlantic Water and Pacific Water, atmospheric forcing, and river and ice runoff into the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>Large scale atmospheric forcing dominates the pressure field and govern the winds across the Arctic. Over the Canada Basin, the Beaufort Gyre and the Transpolar Drift largely influence the general circulation of the surface waters and sea ice. Predominantly anticyclonic atmospheric circulation over the Amerasian Basin creates a convergence and accumulation of the surface layer water in the Canada Basin, the Beaufort Gyre, and the resulting pressure field and geostrophic circulation extends at least down to 300–400 m depth (Rudels, 2019). Transpolar Drift advects sea ice across the Arctic Basin to the Fram Strait with mean speeds can be about ~10 km per day (e.g. Hunkins, 1990).</p>
<p>As such, fresh and cold Arctic Surface Water (or Polar Surface Water), formed by the river runoff and ice melt and comprising surface Polar Mixed Layer – PML, gets involved into the anticyclonic circulation centered over the Beaufort gyre, or joins the Transpolar Drift. (Rudels, 2019). Surface layer can have wide range of temperatures – from the freezing temperature of -1.8 to 5 – 6 &#x00BA;C in bay and fjords, salinity from &lt;31 up to 34.4 and thickness from 20 to 75 m (e.g. Muench, 1970; Bailey, 1957; Rudels, 2019; Lien &amp; Trofimov, 2013).</p>
<p>Surface mixed layer is underlaid by a halocline layer, produced during freezing and salinization of the water column (e.g. Aagaard et al., 1981; Shimada et al., 2005; Rudels, 2019). The vertical mixing that happens during wintertime is crucial for bringing the nutrients up to the surface for the development of spring blooms. Winter convection often reaches the bottom on the shelf, however in the deep Arctic basin it is not possible due to large salinity gradients. There freezing of the ice causes brine rejection, which in turn aggregates underneath the ice forming the halocline. Halocline is also created by advection from the shelves and from neighboring basins; Pacific Winter and Summer waters also contribute to the upper halocline in the Canada Basin. Halocline prevents the heat from underlaying Atlantic water reach the surface (e.g. Loeng 1991; Hunkins, 1990), however, in certain regions the ocean heat can penetrate to the surface and induce sea ice melting (Wang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Deeper currents in the Arctic are in general steered by topography of the basin, comprising a large-scale cyclonic boundary current system (see the map; e.g. Rudels, 2019). After circulating counterclockwise along topographic slopes in the Arctic Ocean, warm Atlantic waters exit the Basin through the western side of the Fram Strait (with East Greenland Current). In the Canada Basin Atlantic Water (AW; T &gt; 0 °C, &#x0001D446; &gt; 33.64 psu) is advected between 300 and 900 m along the continental shelf, as well as circulates cyclonically in the deeper parts of Canada, Makarov and Amundsen Basins. It is usually traced by a core of maximum subsurface temperature, and is defined as water with temperature above 0 C (e.g. Munchow et al., 2016; Rudels, 2019). However, as AW is modified and cooled on its long way from the Fram Strait and Eurasian Basin towards Pacific Arctic, in some studies (e.g. Nikolopoulos et al., 2009; Brugler et al., 2014; Pisareva et al., 2015) the boundary between the Pacific and Atlantic waters is taken as the maximum Ertel potential vorticity, so that AW is defined as water with temperatures higher than -1.26 °C.</p>
<p>Polar Deep Water (PDW) lies beneath Atlantic Water (beneath the lower 0°C isotherm) at 600 – 700 m. PDW has almost uniform salinity (S=~34.94; e.g. Hunkins, 1990), while the temperature slightly decreases with depth down to 2000 m and slightly increases deeper than 2000 m at the adiabatic gradient (Aagaard et a1., 1985b; Hunkins, 1990). PDW forms as a result of mixing of AW and cold and saline Winter Water from the shelves, as well as advection from the Fram Strait, and occupies more than half of the volume of the Arctic Basin. In the central Arctic Ocean itself strong salinity stratification near the surface prevents the formation of deep water (Hunkins, 1990). Various modes of Polar Deep Water are known to exist in the Arctic: Eurasian Basin Deep Water in the Eurasian Basin, Canadian Basin Deep Water (CBDW) in the Canadian Basin (but also includes EBDW), Nordic Deep Water (NDW) in the Nordic Seas (including Greenland, Iceland, Norwegian Seas deep waters; e.g. Rudels et al., 2002). Due to the presence of ridges in the Basin, there is little exchange of the deep waters between the Amerasian and Eurasian basins. Eddy formation and shedding in all the mentioned water masses enhance vertical mixing of the water column, especially in the shelf regions (Rudels, 2019). In general, the deep layer is homogenous, except for the warmer and well mixed bottom layer in some regions, caused by the geothermal heating and stirring by convection from below. Submarine hydrothermal venting along mid-ocean ridges influences the hydrographic structure of the surrounding waters, contributing heat and mass fluxes from the Earth’s crust and mantle, and has important implications for the marine life, providing habitats for the vent-endemic organisms. High-temperature venting on the sea floor warms plumes which ascend through the water column, until they reach a level of neutral buoyancy (supposedly hundreds of meters above the seabed), mixing with ambient waters on their way up (Edmonds et al., 2003).</p>
<p>The climate change over the last decades has resulted in the dramatic sea-ice loss in the Arctic (e.g. in 2007 and 2012; Polyakov et al., 2017). Climatic variations in the Arctic seas and Arctic Basin highly depend on the activity and properties of the inflowing Atlantic Water (Ingvaldsen, 2005), especially while stratification is weakened and vertical mixing subsequently increased. Subsequent “Atlantification” (which is “the northward movement of sea ice in the Barents Sea, with attendant reductions in stratification, increased vertical mixing, and altered primary production”; Polyakov et al., 2017) will have dramatic effects on other geophysical and biogeochemical components of the Arctic Ocean system, e.g. enhance nutrient supply and primary production, alter freshwater storage, intensify shelf-basin exchange.</p>
