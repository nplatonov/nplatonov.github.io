<p><em>Schematic water circulation patterns and geographical place names along the Norwegian coast. Adopted from Loeng (1991), Dalpadado et al. (2003), Ingvaldsen (2005). Dashed line marks the studied region.</em></p>
<p>Hydrography of the Norwegian coastal region is strongly influenced by the advection of the Atlantic water and the complex topography of the coastline – large number of fjords.</p>
<p>Relatively warm and saline Atlantic water (<em>T&gt;3°C, S&gt;35</em>, AW; e.g. Loeng, 1991, Dalpadado et al., 2003) from the Norwegian Atlantic Current (NwAC) in the Norwegian Sea divides into two branches – one flows to the north along the west coast of Svalbard, another turns east onto the Barents Shelf (the North Cape Current – NCaC). At about 30 °E North Cape Current divides to two branches as well. The south branch is known as the Murman Coastal Current. It follows the coast towards White Sea and is freshened by the mixing with ambient waters and freshwater runoff from the White Sea (Loeng, 1991). The northern branch of NCaC is called the Murman Current and continues eastwards. South of the NCaC, the Norwegian Coastal Current transports fresher water masses into the Barents Sea (e.g. Dalpadado et al., 2003; Ingvaldsen, 2005). Both the NwAC and NCaC advect fish, larvae and zooplankton of Norwegian Sea and Atlantic origin (e.g. Dalpadado et al., 2003).</p>
<p>Warm Atlantic water in the barotropic warm core jet (Li &amp; McClimans, 1998) of the NwAC keeps the waters of the Norwegian coast ice-free throughout the year. Li and McClimans (1998) have stated, that mean velocity in this jet is on the order of 10 cm/s with a volume transport of ~ 1 Sv (10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s). During wintertime the Norwegian Coastal Current deepens and becomes narrow, while during summer it is usually rather wide and shallow. Strong southeasterly and southwesterly winds intensify the North Cape Current: it becomes warmer, faster, its transport becomes higher. Due to the non-uniform wind field across the length of the current the width of the current fluctuates, especially between warm/cold season (Ingvaldsen, 2005). Ingvaldsen (2005) also described, that during the warm periods, the NCaC is a two-core current system, while it has only one wider core in cold periods.</p>
<p>Coastal water mass is thought to originate from the mixing of the coastal runoff with the Atlantic waters. It is advected in the Norwegian Coastal current along the Norwegian coast. On its way northwards, the Coastal current turns around the bank of Tromsflaket then returns to the coast before turning to the east. (Loeng, 1991). It can occupy the top ~50 m and has similar temperatures as AW (T&gt;2°C; e.g. Dalpadado et al., 2003), but salinities &lt;34.7. However, in general salinity of the Сoastal Water is very close to the oceanic one, as the volume of freshwater runoff is rather low and due to the influence of warm Atlantic water this region doesn’t freeze up during wintertime. Consequently, the Coastal Water along the Norwegian coast is vertically stratified the entire year, however it can be mixed via winter convection further in the eastern part of the Barents Sea (e.g. around Kolgujev island). During wintertime the vertical stability is weaker, compared to warmer season. Constant stratification of the Coastal Water leads to early phytoplankton bloom – it starts here at approximately the same time as at the ice edge, compared to the Atlantic Water, where the stratification and the bloom are setting in later (Loeng, 1991).</p>
<p>Along the coast of northern Norway, the topography also strongly influences the currents, especially during winter when the stability is low. Mesoscale circulation is established in the fjords, during summertime fronts form between the waters in the fjords, influenced by the coastal runoff and the waters of the Atlantic current. These fronts become a place of concentration of marine life, they determine the diversity and enhance productivity of the region. Along the Norwegian coast and especially in the fjords the interaction of tides with the complicated bottom and sea shore topography can produce strong tidal currents, which can be dangerous for the sea transport (e.g. Maelstrom whirlpool in between Lofoten islands). Strong tidal currents influence the sea level in the fjords, as well as carry oxygen and nutrients. In result, Norwegian fjords provide a unique reproduction habitat for many species and the diversity of species there is rather high.</p>
