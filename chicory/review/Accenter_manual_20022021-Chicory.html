<h3>Chicory</h3>
<p>A tool for querying ArcNet’s priority areas for conservation (PACs)</p>
<p>Chicory is a web-based application to provide information on the make-up of the ArcNet PACs and to facilitate access to the underlying data layers of the ArcNet Marxan analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>To access this information from the Chicory landing page, either choose a PAC from the map on the left or from the list on the right. Clicking a PAC in the map reveals options to either view the PAC report (<em>Details)</em> or a report on the oceanographic <span id="1" class="comment-start" author="timothy james" date="2021-02-02T08:34:00Z">Ok, let’s keep this “Oceanographic background”. “Setting” is more appropriate in this context, but I think “background” will be more understandable to non-native English speakers.</span>background<span id="1" class="comment-end"></span> of the region. Clicking a PAC’s number from the list will open the PAC report directly.</p>
<div class="comment">
<p>&#x21E7; 1. “Oceanographic description”?</p>
</div>
<p>The PAC report summarizes key metrics of the selected PAC. An overview map (left) and closeup (right) show the selected PAC in the context of other PACs in the study area, existing protected areas, and migration bottle necks. Note the blue bounding box that is provided in both maps for scale.</p>
<p><span id="2" class="comment-start" author="timothy james" date="2021-02-18T11:11:00Z"><span custom-style="annotation reference"></span>I think the text that goes with these statistics is pretty clear now, but Boris thought we shouldn’t take anything for granted. So I’ve added this section to provide a brief description of each summary statistic. If we later think this isn’t necessary, it can be deleted. Some of it is a bit repetitive, but it might be helpful. ¶ Also, I think “summary statistics” is the correct way to reference these data.</span>Below the maps is an array of summary statistics for the chosen PAC, including:<span id="2" class="comment-end"><span custom-style="annotation reference"></span></span></p>

<td><p>The most widely used software for systematic marine conservation planning. It uses an optimisation algorithm to find multiple “good” spatial solutions to achieve predefined conservation goals. Importantly, as a decision-support tool, Marxan does not provide just one optimised solution. It offers various spatial <em>scenarios</em> that achieve the conservation goals through iterative analysis cycles and expert review and adjustment. The process is based on the data used in the analysis (the <em>conservation features</em>); a set of <em>conservation targets</em> for the features; and a function that defines the “cost” of prioritising areas for the purpose of conservation.</p>

I specified MIT for github repo, because 1) no restrictions for my source code, 2) no external data with restrictions were used. So, Accenter satisfies my desired license (MIT, I hope this right). External data (outside of my repo) in Accenter may have different restrictions. In ArcNet, metadata contains “Use Restrictions” field (it presents for CF reports in Chicory), but this is not a license. Cell values in Accenter is data, which, perhaps, can be distributed under certain license with accumulated restrictions of source data. ¶ For Chicory with tables and figures, I think, “Creative Commons” group is more appropriated (CC-BY?) ¶ On the next step WWF will be the host of A+C.
