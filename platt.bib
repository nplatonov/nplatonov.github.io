  abstract  = {The melt extent of the snow on the Greenland ice sheet is of considerable
	importance to the ice sheetвЂ™s mass and energy balance, as well
	as Arctic and global climates. By comparing passive microwave satellite
	data to field observations, variations in melt extent have been detected
	by establishing melt thresholds in the cross-polarized gradient ratio
	{(XPGR).} The {XPGR,} defined as the normalized difference between
	the {19-GHz} horizontal channel and the {37-GHz} vertical channel
	of the Special Sensor {Microwave/Imager} {(SSM/I),} exploits the
	different effects of snow wetness on different frequencies and polarizations
	and establishes a distinct melt signal. Using this {XPGR} melt signal,
	seasonal and interannual variations in snowmelt extent of the ice
	sheet are studied. The melt is found to be most extensive on the
	western side of the ice sheet and peaks in late July. Moreover, there
	is a notable increasing trend in melt area between the years 1979
	and 1991 of 4.4\% per year, which came to an abrupt halt in 1992
	after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. A similar trend is observed in
	the temperatures at six coastal stations. The relationship between
	the warming trend and increasing melt trend between 1979 and 1991
	suggests that a {1В°C} temperature rise corresponds to an increase
	in melt area of 73000 km2, which in general exceeds one standard
	deviation of the natural melt area variability.},

Available since 1978, multichannel passive microwave data have great potential for long term climate monitoring. In order to ensure consistent data sets for such long term monitoring, the relations between the microwave brightness temperatures from similar sensors on successive satellite platforms must be understood. In this study the 19,22. and {37GHz} channels of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program {(DMSP)} F8 and F11 Special Sensor Microwave Imager {(SSMI)} instruments are compared. While the analysis shows that the two data sets are highly correlated with correlation coefficients greater than 0В·98. the consistency between the two data sets can be improved by applying small corrections in the order of I deg K. Two sets of regression coefficients are provided for adjusting the F11 data to the F8 baseline.},

	Snow grain morphology, density, salinity, temperature and wetness
	were measured; the volume fractions of air, ice, brine, and the complex
	dielectric constant of the snow were modeled over a 3-cm vertical
	resolution spanning a seasonal period from April to June. Our results
	show that over the vertical dimension the snow grain morphology,

	covary. The statistical characterization of the vertical grain morphology
	indicates that two distinct layers occurred under cold {(в€’20В°C)}
	and three layers under warm {(в€’5В°C)} atmospheric temperatures.
	Over the seasonal period it was shown that new snow was deposited
	at about 250 kgВ·mв€’3 and quickly compacted to 375 kgВ·mв€’3 Snow
	grains grew at different rates within the snow cover because of differing

	closely the seasonal and vertical patterns of grain morphology, salinity,
	temperature, density and the phase proportions of water within the
	snow volume. As the season evolved, the increasing brine volumes

  abstract = {Significant advances are being made in our understanding of the Arctic
	sea ice-climate system. The mean circulation of the Arctic sea ice
	cover is now well defined through analysis of data from drifting
	stations and buoys. Analysis of nearly 20 years of daily satellite
	data from optical, infrared, and passive microwave sensors has documented
	the regional variability in monthly ice extent, concentration, and
	surface albedo. Advances in modeling include better treatments of
	sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics, improved atmosphere-ice-ocean
	coupling, and the development of high resolution regional models.
	Diagnostic studies of monthly and interannual sea ice variability
	have benefited from better sea ice data and geostrophic wind analyses
	that incorporate drifting buoy data. Some evidence exists for a small
	retreat of Arctic sea ice over the last 2 decades, but there are
	large decadal fluctuations in regional ice extent. Antiphase relationships
	between ice anomalies in different sectors can be related to changes
	in atmospheric circulation. Evidence suggests that episodes of significant
	salinity reduction in the North Atlantic, associated with extensive
	sea ice in the Greenland Sea, may be a manifestation of a decadal
	oscillation in the Arctic climate system. Aspects of the Arctic system
	in need of further attention include the surface energy budget and
	its variability, particularly with respect to the roles of cloud
	cover and surface types in summer. Sea ice thickness distribution
	data remain meager, and there are many unknowns regarding the circulation
	and hydrologic cycle of the Arctic Ocean and its links to the world
	ocean. Planned measurements from a new generation of satellites,
	supported by field programs, will provide much needed data to address
	these issues. },

This comparative study evaluates several methods used to estimate sea-ice melt and freeze onset dates: (1) the melt onset database derived from {SSM/I} passive microwave brightness temperatures {(Tbs)} using Drobot and Anderson's {[J.} Geophys. Res. 106 (2001) 24033] Advanced Horizontal Range Algorithm {(AHRA)} and distributed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center {(NSIDC);} (2) the International Arctic Buoy {Program/Polar} Exchange at the Sea {(IABP/POLES)} surface air temperatures {(SATs);} (3) an elaborated version of the {AHRA} that uses {IABP/POLES} to avoid anomalous results {(Passive} Microwave and Surface Temperature Analysis {[PMSTA]);} (4) another elaborated version of the {AHRA} that uses Tb variance to avoid anomalous results {(Mean} Differences and Standard Deviation Analysis {[MDSDA]);} (5) Smith's {[J.} Geophys. Res. 103 (1998) 27753] vertically polarized Tb algorithm for estimating melt onset in multiyear {(MY)} ice {(SSM/I} {19V-37V);} and (6) analyses of concurrent backscattering cross section ([sigma]пїЅ) and brightness temperature {(Tb)} from {OKEAN-01} satellite series. Melt onset and freeze onset maps were created and compared to understand how the estimates vary between different satellite instruments and methods over different Arctic sea-ice regions. Comparisons were made to evaluate relative sensitivities among the methods to slight adjustments of the Tb calibration coefficients and algorithm threshold values. Compared to the {PMSTA} method, the {AHRA} method tended to estimate significantly earlier melt dates, likely caused by the {AHRA's} susceptibility to prematurely identify melt onset conditions. In contrast, the {IABP/POLES} surface air temperature data tended to estimate later melt and earlier freeze in all but perennial ice. The {MDSDA} method was least sensitive to small adjustments of the {SMMR-SSM/I} inter-satellite calibration coefficients. Differences among methods varied by latitude. Freeze onset dates among methods were most disparate in southern latitudes, and tended to converge northward. Surface air temperatures {(IABP/POLES)} indicated freeze onset well before the {MDSDA} method, especially in southern peripheral seas, while {PMSTA} freeze estimates were generally intermediate. Surface air temperature data estimated latest melt onset dates in southern latitudes, but earliest melt onset in northern latitudes. The {PMSTA} estimated earliest melt onset dates in southern regions, and converged with the {MDSDA} northward. Because sea-ice melt and freeze are dynamical transitional processes, differences among these methods are associated with differing sensitivities to changing stages of environmental and physical development. These studies contribute to the growing body of documentation about the levels of disparity obtained when Arctic seasonal transition parameters are estimated using various types of microwave data and algorithms.},

	annual ice. Average annual melt dates, freeze dates, and melt durations
	in annual ice were significantly correlated with seasonal strength
	of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Following high-index AO winters (January--March),
	spring melt tended to be earlier and autumn freeze later, leading
	to longer melt season durations. The largest increases in melt duration
	were observed in the eastern Siberian Arctic, coincident with cyclonic
	low pressure and ice motion anomalies associated with high-index

	duration increased 2--3 weeks in the northern East Siberian and Chukchi

	melt distributions did not show evidence of reestablishing spatial
	patterns similar to those observed during the 1979--88 low-index

	pattern of freeze chronology under low-index AO conditions.},

  abstract = {Accurate quantification and characterization of the Arctic summer
	ice cover are needed for mass balance, heat flux, and modeling studies
	in the region. A general assessment of the state and basic characteristics
	of the ice cover can best be done in summer because it is when the
	perennial component is fully revealed. The main source of summer
	ice information has been passive microwave and to a lesser degree
	active microwave data. However, the emissivity and backscatter of
	sea ice are abnormal and difficult to resolve during this time period,
	causing large uncertainties in the interpretation of satellite data.
	In this study we examined the state of the sea ice cover by using
	special scanning microwave imager {(SSM/I),} synthetic aperture radar
	{(SAR),} and advanced very high resolution radiometer {(AVHRR)} satellite
	data synergistically. The surface and radiative characteristics of
	the summer ice cover were evaluated in the context of three special
	events: onset of melt, melt ponding, and freeze-up. These events
	affect the emissivity and backscatter and may alter the albedo and
	ice structure. Onset of melt is readily detectable and is shown to
	migrate rapidly to the north in June. Melt ponding is not directly
	observable but is postulated to be the main cause of the decreases
	in brightness temperatures and large discrepancies between the {SSM/I}
	and {SAR} ice concentration results in many areas. In these areas,
	{SAR} and {AVHRR} results show concentrations near 100\%, while the
	{SSM/I} data were as low as 70\%. During freeze-up the ice signatures
	are still quite different from those of midwinter ice, but the ice
	concentrations from {SSM/I} generally agree well with those from
	{SAR} data. Our results show that, generally, the average ice concentration
	within the pack is usually greater than 90\% during the summer, which
	is substantially larger than that inferred previously from passive
	microwave data. The use of combined {SAR} and {SSM/I} data may also
	provide melt-ponding fraction and first-order estimate of albedo

	of polar bears and seals in the Chukchi Sea. We investigate the consequences
	of different levels of survey effort, flight track allocation and

	For bearded seals (0.07 animals km-2) and ringed seals (1.29 animals

	to achieve target precision levels (coefficient of variation (CV)\&lt;20\%)
	for a 2.94{\texttimes}105 km2 study area. For polar bears (provisionally,
	0.003 animals km-2), 12 flights traversing ≈11 760 km resulted in
	CVs ranging from 28 to 35\%. Estimators were relatively unbiased
	with similar precision over different flight track allocation strategies
	and estimation models, although some combinations had superior performance.
	These findings suggest that instrument-based aerial surveys may provide
	a viable means for monitoring seal and polar bear populations on

	associated with a decrease in the areal cover of snow and ice and
	a corresponding increase in the surface temperature, further decreasing
	the areal cover of snow and ice. It is shown that the sea ice-albedo
	feedback can operate even in multiyear pack ice, without the disappearance
	of this ice, associated with internal processes occurring within
	the multiyear ice pack (e.g., duration of the snow cover, ice thickness,
	ice distribution, lead fraction, and melt pond characteristics).
	The strength of the ice-albedo feedback mechanism is compared for
	several different thermodynamic sea ice models: a new model that
	includes ice thickness distribution, the Ebert and Curry model, the
	Maykut and Untersteiner model, and the Semtner level-3 and level-0
	models. The climate forcing is chosen to be a perturbation of the
	surface heat flux, and cloud and water vapor feedbacks are inoperative
	so that the effects of the sea ice-albedo feedback mechanism can
	be isolated. The inclusion of melt ponds significantly strengthens
	the ice-albedo feedback, while the ice thickness distribution decreases
	the strength of the modeled sea ice-albedo feedback. It is emphasized
	that accurately modeling present-day sea ice thickness is not adequate

  abstract = {A conceptual model of the Arctic climate system is generated by taking
	two key components in the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system, having
	a basis on a box model with water exchanges among the Arctic Basin,
	the {Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian} {(GIN)} Seas and the North Atlantic.
	One of the key components is deep water formation in the {GIN} Seas
	induced by the saline Atlantic inflow to the area. The second key
	component is a positive feedback between a more intense (or weaker)
	Polar Vortex and less (or more) ice cover in the Arctic Basin. The
	system possesses a decadal oscillation in a limited range of the
	combination of the key component intensities. This oscillatory state
	is potentially relevant to the decadal oscillations remarkable in
	the Arctic climate only for last three decades. The present study
	promotes an attempt to examine responses of the Arctic atmospheric
	circulation to decadal variability in the surface heat flux, as these
	responses are the most uncertain. },

  abstract  = {The statistics of surface air temperature observations obtained from
	buoys, manned drifting stations, and meteorological land stations
	in the Arctic during 1979вЂ“97 are analyzed. Although the basic statistics
	agree with what has been published in various climatologies, the
	seasonal correlation length scales between the observations are shorter
	than the annual correlation length scales, especially during summer
	when the inhomogeneity between the ice-covered ocean and the land
	is most apparent. During autumn, winter, and spring, the monthly
	mean correlation length scales are approximately constant at about
	1000 km; during summer, the length scales are much shorter, that
	is, as low as 300 km. These revised scales are particularly important
	in the optimal interpolation of data on surface air temperature {(SAT)}
	and are used in the analysis of an improved {SAT} dataset called
	International Arctic Buoy {Programme/Polar} Exchange at the Sea Surface
	{(IABP/POLES).} Compared to observations from land stations and the
	Russian North Pole drift stations, the {IABP/POLES} dataset has higher
	correlations and lower rms errors than previous {SAT} fields and
	provides better temperature estimates, especially during summer in
	the marginal ice zones. In addition, the revised correlation length
	scales allow data taken at interior land stations to be included
	in the optimal interpretation analysis without introducing land biases
	to grid points over the ocean. The new analysis provides 12-h fields
	of air temperatures on a 100-km rectangular grid for all land and
	ocean areas of the Arctic region for the years 1979вЂ“97. The {IABP/POLES}
	dataset is then used to study spatial and temporal variations in
	{SAT.} This dataset shows that on average melt begins in the marginal
	seas by the first week of June and advances rapidly over the Arctic
	Ocean, reaching the pole by 19 June, 2 weeks later. Freeze begins
	at the pole on 16 August, and the freeze isotherm advances more slowly
	than the melt isotherm. Freeze returns to the marginal seas a month
	later than at the pole, on 21 September. Near the North Pole, the
	melt season length is about 58 days, while near the margin, the melt
	season is about 100 days. A trend of {+1В°C} (decade)в€’1 is found

	shows a slight shortening of the melt season. These changes in surface

  abstract  = {Data collected by the International Arctic Buoy Programme from 1979
	to 1998 are analyzed to obtain statistics of sea level pressure {(SLP)}
	and sea ice motion {(SIM).} The annual and seasonal mean fields agree
	with those obtained in previous studies of Arctic climatology. The
	data show a {3-hPa} decrease in decadal mean {SLP} over the central
	Arctic Ocean between 1979вЂ“88 and 1989вЂ“98. This decrease in {SLP}
	drives a cyclonic trend in {SIM,} which resembles the structure of
	the Arctic Oscillation {(AO).} Regression maps of {SIM} during the
	wintertime {(JanuaryвЂ“March)} {AO} index show 1) an increase in
	ice advection away from the coast of the East Siberian and Laptev
	Seas, which should have the effect of producing more new thin ice
	in the coastal flaw leads; 2) a decrease in ice advection from the
	western Arctic into the eastern Arctic; and 3) a slight increase
	in ice advection out of the Arctic through Fram Strait. Taken together,
	these changes suggest that at least part of the thinning of sea ice
	recently observed over the Arctic Ocean can be attributed to the
	trend in the {AO} toward the high-index polarity. Rigor et al. showed
	that year-to-year variations in the wintertime {AO} imprint a distinctive
	signature on surface air temperature {(SAT)} anomalies over the Arctic,
	which is reflected in the spatial pattern of temperature change from
	the 1980s to the 1990s. Here it is shown that the memory of the wintertime
	{AO} persists through most of the subsequent year: spring and autumn
	{SAT} and summertime sea ice concentration are all strongly correlated
	with the {AO} index for the previous winter. It is hypothesized that
	these delayed responses reflect the dynamical influence of the {AO}
	on the thickness of the wintertime sea ice, whose persistent вЂњfootprintвЂќ
	is reflected in the heat fluxes during the subsequent spring, in
	the extent of open water during the subsequent summer, and the heat
	liberated in the freezing of the open water during the subsequent
	autumn.},

	the region is attracting growing attention of decision-makers and
	business communities. In light of the above it is necessary to protect
	the biodiversity of the regional marine ecosystems in the most effective
	way possible, namely by establishing a network of marine protected
	areas.
	
	* Identifying conservation priority areas is a key step towards this
	goal. To achieve it, a study based on a systematic conservation planning
	approach was conducted. An expanded group of experts used the MARXAN
	algorithm to produce initial results, then discussed and refined
	them to select 47 conservation priority areas in the Russian Arctic
	seas.
	
	* The resulting network covers nearly 25\% of the Russian Arctic seas,
	which guarantees proportional representation of their biodiversity
	as well as achieving connectivity, sustainability and naturalness.
	This was largely made possible by the selected methodology, based
	on the MARXAN decision support tool supplemented by extensive post-analysis
	that helped fill any gaps inevitable in the formal approach.
	
	* Although available data were sparse, and of varying quality and
	a single regionalization scheme could not be used (as is often the
	case for such areas), the selected approach has proven successful
	for such a large area that covers both the coastal zone and parts
	of the High Seas. Such an approach could be used further to identify

	averages of mean ice concentration, the biases introduced by the

	the date of melt onset using the {ERS} 1 {SAR} and apply the algorithm
	first to the {SAR} data for which we have corresponding buoy temperatures.
	The melt onset dates estimated by the {SAR} algorithm agree with
	those obtained independently from the temperature data to within
	4 days or less, with the exception of one case in which temperatures
	oscillated about {0В°C} for several weeks. Lastly, we apply the algorithm
	to the entire {ERS} 1 {SAR} data record acquired by the Alaska {SAR}
	Facility for the Beaufort Sea north of {73В°N} during the spring
	of 1992, to produce a map of the dates of melt onset over an area
	roughly 1000 km on a side. The progression of melt onset is primarily
	poleward but shows a weak meridional dependence at latitudes of approximately
	{76В°вЂ“77В°N.} Melting begins in the southern part of the study
	region on June 13 and by June 20 has progressed to the northernmost
	part of the region.},

	data collected during the 1997 {Collaborative-Interdisciplinary}
	Cryospheric Experiment {(C-ICE'97)} near Resolute Bay, Nunavut. This

	wind speed explained {\textgreater} 90\% of the variation in ПѓВ°.
	{RADARSAT-1} ПѓВ° was sensitive {(R} 2 = 0.80) to the fractional
	coverage of melt ponds during windy conditions (в€ј 5.3 m sв€’1).
	Spatial and temporal coincident measurements of {RADARSAT-1} ПѓВ°
	and the integrated shortwave albedo revealed a strong negative statistical
	correlation {(R} 2 = 0.91) during windy conditions (в€ј 5.3 m sв€’1).
	A weaker, but strong, negative relationship {(R} 2 = 0.78) was observed
	for less windy conditions (в€ј 3.2 m sв€’1), and a very weak positive
	relationship {(R} 2 = 0.19) was found for low wind speed conditions

  abstract = {It is well established that periods of high North Atlantic oscillation
	{(NAO)} index are characterized by a weakening of the surface high
	pressure and surface anticyclone in the Beaufort Sea and the intensification
	of the cyclonic circulation in the eastern Arctic Ocean. The response
	of Arctic sea ice to these atmospheric changes has been studied with
	a thickness distribution sea-ice model coupled to an ocean model.
	During a period of high {NAO,} 1989вЂ“96, the model shows a substantial
	reduction of ice advection into the eastern Arctic from the Canada
	Basin, and an increase of ice export through Fram Strait, both of
	which tend to deplete thick ice in the eastern Arctic Ocean and enhance
	it in the western Arctic, in an uneven dipolar pattern we call the
	{EastвЂ“West} Arctic Anomaly Pattern {(EWAAP).} From the period 1979вЂ“88
	with a {lower-NAO} index to the period 1988вЂ“96 with a {high-NAO}
	index, the simulated ice volume in the eastern Arctic drops by about
	a quarter, while that in the western Arctic increases by 16\%. Overall,
	the Arctic Ocean loses 6\%. The change from 1987 to 1996 is even
	largerвЂ”a loss of some 20\% in ice volume for the whole Arctic.
	Both the model and satellite data show a significant reduction in
	ice extent in the eastern Arctic and in the Arctic Ocean as a whole.
	There are corresponding changes in open water and therefore in ice
	growth, which tend to moderate the anomaly, and in lateral melting,
	which tends to enhance the anomaly. During the high {NAO} and strong
	{EWAAP} period, 1989вЂ“96, the eastern (western) Arctic has more
	(less) open water and enhanced (reduced) winter ice growth, so ice
	growth stabilizes the ice cover. On the other hand, the increased
	(decreased) open water enhances (reduces) summer melt by lowering
	(increasing) albedo in the eastern (western) Arctic. The nonlinearity
	of iceвЂ“ albedo feedback causes the increased summer melt in the
	eastern Arctic to dominate the thermodynamic response and to collaborate
	with the ice advection pattern to enhance the {EWAAP} during high
	{NAO.}},

	earlier and autumn freeze later, leading to longer melt season durations.
	The largest increases in melt duration were observed in the eastern
	Siberian Arctic, coincident with cyclonic low pressure and ice motion
	anomalies associated with high-index {AO} phases. Following a positive
	{AO} shift in 1989, mean annual melt duration increased 2\&\#8211;3
	weeks in the northern East Siberian and Chukchi Seas. Decreasing
	correlations between consecutive-year maps of melt onset in annual
	ice during 1979\&\#8211;2001 indicated increasing spatial variability
	and unpredictability in melt distributions from one year to the next.
	Despite recent declines in the winter {AO} index, recent melt distributions
	did not show evidence of reestablishing spatial patterns similar
	to those observed during the 1979\&\#8211;88 low-index {AO} period.
	Recent freeze distributions have become increasingly similar to those
	observed during 1979\&\#8211;88, suggesting a recurrent spatial pattern
	of freeze chronology under low-index {AO} conditions.},

  abstract = {Forty years (1958\&\#8211;97) of reanalysis products and corresponding
	sea ice concentration data are used to document Arctic sea ice variability
	and its association with surface air temperature {(SAT)} and sea
	level pressure {(SLP)} throughout the Northern Hemisphere extratropics.
	The dominant mode of winter {(January\&\#8211;March)} sea ice variability
	exhibits out-of-phase fluctuations between the western and eastern
	North Atlantic, together with a weaker dipole in the North Pacific.
	The time series of this mode has a high winter-to-winter autocorrelation
	(0.69) and is dominated by decadal-scale variations and a longer-term
	trend of diminishing ice cover east of Greenland and increasing ice
	cover west of Greenland. Associated with the dominant pattern of
	winter sea ice variability are large-scale changes in {SAT} and {SLP}
	that closely resemble the North Atlantic oscillation. The associated
	{SAT} and surface sensible and latent heat flux anomalies are largest
	over the portions of the marginal sea ice zone in which the trends
	of ice coverage have been greatest, although the well-documented
	warming of the northern continental regions is also apparent. The
	temporal and spatial relationships between the {SLP} and ice anomaly
	fields are consistent with the notion that atmospheric circulation
	anomalies force the sea ice variations. However, there appears to
	be a local response of the atmospheric circulation to the changing
	sea ice cover east of Greenland. Specifically, cyclone frequencies
	have increased and mean {SLPs} have decreased over the retracted
	ice margin in the Greenland Sea, and these changes differ from those
	associated directly with the North Atlantic oscillation. The dominant
	mode of sea ice variability in summer {(July\&\#8211;September)}
	is more spatially uniform than that in winter. Summer ice extent
	for the Arctic as a whole has exhibited a nearly monotonic decline
	(\&\#8722;4\&\#37; decade\&\#8722;1) during the past 40 yr. Summer
	sea ice variations appear to be initiated by atmospheric circulation
	anomalies over the high Arctic in late spring. Positive ice\&\#8211;albedo
	feedback may account for the relatively long delay (2\&\#8211;3 months)
	between the time of atmospheric forcing and the maximum ice response,
	and it may have served to amplify the summer ice retreat.},

  abstract = { AbstractCloud response to synoptic conditions over the Beaufort and Chukchi seasonal ice zone is examined. Four synoptic states with distinct thermodynamic and dynamic signatures are identified using ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 2000 to 2014. CloudSat and CALIPSO observations suggest control of clouds by synoptic states. Warm continental air advection is associated with the fewest low-level clouds, while cold air advection generates the most low-level clouds. Low-level clouds are related to lower-tropospheric stability and both are regulated by synoptic conditions. High-level clouds are associated with humidity and vertical motions in the upper atmosphere. Observed cloud vertical and spatial variability is reproduced well in ERA-Interim, but winter low-level cloud fraction is overestimated. This suggests that synoptic conditions constrain the spatial extent of clouds through the atmospheric structure, while the parameterizations for cloud microphysics and boundary layer physics are critical for the life cycle of clouds in numerical models. Sea ice melt onset is related to synoptic conditions. Melt onsets occur more frequently and earlier with warm air advection. Synoptic conditions with the highest temperatures and precipitable water are most favorable for melt onsets even though fewer low-level clouds are associated with these conditions. },

  abstract      = {Satellite radiotelemetry has provided great insights into the movements and behaviors of polar bears (Ursus maritimus). The diameter of the neck of adult male polar bears exceeds that of their head, however, and radio collars slip off. This has limited collection of movement information to that from radio-collared females. To overcome this difficulty and gather information about their movements, we surgically implanted satellite radio transmitters into 7 male polar bears during 1996 and 1997. We compared movements of implanted males with those of 104 adult females radio-collared between 1985 and 1995. Transmitters were implanted under the skin on the midline of the top of the neck and were equipped with percutaneous antennae. Implanted transmitters operated for up to 161 days providing 3217 satellite relocations. While transmitting, radios implanted in males provided a larger proportion of the highest quality category of position fixes than was obtained from radio-collared females. However, all implanted radios ceased transmitting before reaching their projected life-span. The abrupt termination of transmission from implanted radios suggested mechanical rather than electronic failure. Mean rates of short-term movement for males (1.18 km/h) were lower than for solitary females, females with cubs, and females with yearlings (1.70, 1.84, and 1.95 km/h, respectively). Net geographic movements from the beginning to the end of each month were comparable for males (mean = 135 km) and females (mean = 114, 152, and 168 km). Mean azimuths of these net movements also appeared to be similar. Monthly activity-area sizes for males (mean = 8541 km2) were comparable to those for females (mean = 3698, 9397, and 10 585 km2) during the time period of comparison. In contrast to the other movement measures, males traveled longer mean distances (387 km) each month than did females (217, 289, and 302 km). Movements of males, it appears, were more directed than those of females, but males confined their travels to similar-sized areas.},

  abstract  = {Climate change is expected to alter many species{\textquoteright} habitat. A species{\textquoteright} ability to adjust to these changes is partially determined by their ability to adjust habitat selection preferences to new environmental conditions. Sea ice loss has forced polar bears (Ursus maritimus) to spend longer periods annually over less productive waters, which may be a primary driver of population declines. A negative population response to greater time spent over less productive water implies, however, that prey are not also shifting their space use in response to sea ice loss. We show that polar bear habitat selection in the Chukchi Sea has not changed between periods before and after significant sea ice loss, leading to a 75\% reduction of highly selected habitat in summer. Summer was the only period with loss of highly selected habitat, supporting the contention that summer will be a critical period for polar bears as sea ice loss continues. Our results indicate that bears are either unable to shift selection patterns to reflect new prey use patterns or that there has not been a shift towards polar basin waters becoming more productive for prey. Continued sea ice loss is likely to further reduce habitat with population-level consequences for polar bears.},

  abstract  = {The first year of life is typically the most critical to a pinnipedвЂ™s survival, especially for Arctic phocids which are weaned at only a few weeks of age and left to locate and capture prey on their own. Their seasonal movements and habitat selection are therefore important factors in their survival. During a cooperative effort between scientists and subsistence hunters in October 2004, 2005, and 2006, 13 female and 13 male young (i.e., age <2) bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were tagged with satellite-linked dive recorders (SDRs) in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. Shortly after being released, most seals moved south with the advancing sea-ice through the Bering Strait and into the Bering Sea where they spent the winter and early spring. The SDRs of 17 (8 female and 9 male) seals provided frequent high-quality positions in the Bering Sea; their data were used in our analysis. To investigate habitat selection, we simulated 20 tracks per seal by randomly selecting from the pooled distributions of the absolute bearings and swim speeds of the tagged seals. For each point in the observed and simulated tracks, we obtained the depth, sea-ice concentration, and the distances to sea-ice, open water, the shelf break and coastline. Using logistic regression with a stepwise model selection procedure, we compared the simulated tracks to those of the tagged seals and obtained a model for describing habitat selection. The regression coefficients indicated that the bearded seals in our study selected locations near the ice edge. In contrast, aerial surveys of the bearded seal population, predominantly composed of adults, indicated higher abundances in areas farther north and in heavier pack ice. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is the result of behavioral differences related to age. Ice concentration was also shown to be a statistically significant variable in our model. All else being equal, areas of higher ice concentration are selected for up to about 80%. The effects of sex and bathymetry were not statistically significant. The close association of young bearded seals to the ice edge in the Bering Sea is important given the likely effects of climate warming on the extent of sea-ice and subsequent changes in ice edge habitat.},

Arctic MIZ widths were measured in satellite era sea ice concentrations over the years 1979–2011 using a recently published MIZ width analysis method. Over the record, the warm season (July–September) MIZ width increased by 13 km decade−1, amounting to a 39\% widening. This widening trend resulted from a marked poleward advancement of the MIZ poleward edge into regions where sea ice was increasingly younger and thinner at the beginning of annual melt, while the MIZ's equatorward edge moved comparatively little. The warm season MIZ widening contrasted in sign and strength with a cold season (February–April) MIZ narrowing trend (4 km decade−1, amounting to a 15\% narrowing).}

The Beaufort Gyre tends to harbor the oldest (>10 years old) sea ice in the western Arctic while direct ice advection pathways toward the Transpolar Drift Stream maintain relatively young (≤5 years) ice in the eastern Arctic. Persistent net losses (−4.2\% yr−1) in extent of ice >10 years old (10+ year age class) were observed during 1989–2003. Since the mid‐1990s, losses to the 10+ year age class lacked compensation by recruitment due to a prior depletion of all mature (6–10 year) age classes. Survival of the 1994 and 1996–1998 sea ice generations reestablished most mature age classes, and thereby the potential to increase extent of the 10+ year age class during the mid‐2000s.}

In this paper, a relationship among the number of yearlings per litter and 2-year-olds per litter is used to derive the survivorship of yearlings, which is then used to solve for the number of cubs per litter. When this relationship was applied to published population data from North America, the resulting estimated survival rates of yearlings ranged from 0.70 to 0.75, and the estimated average number of cubs per litter was between 1.70 and 1.98. These findings indicate that current estimates of sustainable yield for polar bear populations may be in error because the reproductive rate of adult females was likely to be underestimated, and the survival rate of cubs of the year was likely to be overestimated.},

   abstract = "Polynyas are persistent and recurrent regions of open water and/or thin ice or reduced ice concentration, tens to tens of thousands of square kilometers in areal extent, that occur within the sea ice zones of both hemispheres at locations where a more consolidated and thicker ice cover would be climatologically expected. Rather than simply constituting recurrent “windows” in the sea ice, polynyas are profoundly affected by, and intimately linked to, local and even regional ice conditions (i.e., the “icescape”). They respond sensitively to thermodynamic and dynamic forcing by the ocean and atmosphere and entail ecologically important “oases” that enable birds and mammals to overwinter at high latitudes and encourage enhanced primary production in the spring. In this review, we introduce the concept of polynyas from the perspective of the sea ice conditions/processes that define them. We discuss the unique characteristics of polynyas in both polar regions, and assess their possible response/contribution to climate variability and change. An inventory of Northern Hemisphere polynyas is presented, based primarily of satellite data analysis but also on information from the literature and aboriginal peoples. Summary statistics on polynya opening and closing dates are also provided, along with information on the availability of light relative to the seasonal cycles of sea ice. In the Southern Hemisphere, we present an update of an inventory of Antarctic polynyas and discuss how coastal, glacial and deep-ocean processes affect their and distribution. Two important polynyas are examined in more detail, i.e., the North Water (NOW) polynya in the north and the Mertz Glacier polynya in the south. These case studies focus on details of the different physical processes driving their creation, maintenance and dissolution. Each of these polynyas has been the focus of dedicated in situ research programmes in recent years."

        abstract = {Climate change is predicted to expand the ice-free season in western Hudson Bay and when it grows to 180 days, 28–48% of adult male polar bears are projected to starve unless nutritional deficits can be offset by foods consumed on land. We updated a dynamic energy budget model developed by Molnar et al. to allow influx of additional energy from novel terrestrial foods (lesser snow geese, eggs, caribou) that polar bears currently consume as part of a mixed diet while on land. We calculated the units of each prey, alone and in combination, needed to alleviate these lethal energy deficits under conditions of resting or limited movement (2 km d-1) prior to starvation. We further considered the total energy available from each sex and age class of each animal prey over the period they would overlap land-bound polar bears and calculated the maximum number of starving adult males that could be sustained on each food during the ice-free season. Our results suggest that the net energy from land-based food, after subtracting costs of limited movement to obtain it, could eliminate all projected nutritional deficits of starving adult male polar bears and likely other demographic groups as well. The hunting tactics employed, success rates as well as behavior and abundance of each prey will determine the realized energetic values for individual polar bears. Although climate change may cause a phenological mismatch between polar bears and their historical ice-based prey, it may simultaneously yield a new match with certain land-based foods. If polar bears can transition their foraging behavior to effectively exploit these resources, predictions for starvation-related mortality may be overestimated for western Hudson Bay. We also discuss potential complications with stable-carbon isotope studies to evaluate utilization of land-based foods by polar bears including metabolic effects of capture-related stress and consuming a mixed diet.},

The density and distribution of marine litter and mega-fauna have been traditionally monitored through observer-based methods, yet the advent of new technologies has introduced aerial photography as an alternative monitoring method. However, to integrate results produced by different monitoring techniques and consider the photographic method a viable alternative, this ‘new’ methodology must be validated. This study aims to compare observations obtained from the concurrent application of observer-based and photographic methods during aerial surveys. To do so, a Partenavia P-68 aircraft equipped with an RGB sensor was used to monitor the waters off the Spanish Mediterranean coast along 12 transects (941 km). Over 10000 images were collected and checked manually by a photo-interpreter to detect potential targets, which were classified as floating marine macro-litter, mega-fauna and seabirds. The two methods allowed the detection of items from the three categories and proved equally effective for the detection of cetaceans, sea turtles and large fish on the sea surface. However, the photographic method was more effective for floating litter detection and the observer-based method was more effective for seabird detection. These results provide the first validation of the use of aerial photography to monitor floating litter and mega-fauna over the marine surface."

Garbage patches in the world’s oceans are well documented, but quantitative assessments of floating debris are still lacking in some major areas. The Mediterranean Sea is one such area, despite being one of the most plastic polluted environments. We used data from the first international basin-scale survey of the Mediterranean Sea to provide the first abundance estimate of floating mega-debris (>30 cm) and map their distribution over the entire Mediterranean Sea. We estimated the total number of floating mega-debris at 2.9 million items, taking into account imperfect detection. Items larger than 30 cm represent only one fourth of the complete load of anthropogenic debris (>2 cm) in the Mediterranean, which scales up the estimate to 11.5 million floating debris. The highest densities were observed in the central Mediterranean, and the lowest in the eastern basin. This acute marine pollution might threaten to disrupt entire ecosystems through its impact on marine fauna (entanglement, ingestion, contamination), eventually impacting the tourism industry and the well-being of Mediterranean populations."

   abstract = {Abstract Significant information gaps exist regarding the status of polar bears, especially with respect to the impacts of climate change, across large portions of the Arctic. To obtain an updated abundance estimate for the Foxe Basin population, we conducted comprehensive aerial surveys during the 2009 and 2010 ice-free seasons, when bears are confined to land. We sampled with mark-recapture distance sampling protocols on inland and coastal transects and surveyed small islands and remnant ice floes. We observed 816 and 1,003 bears in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Although detection functions differed substantially between years, estimates were consistent between analytical methods and years. Averaging four estimates (two from each year) yielded 2,585 (2,096–3,189) bears, which is similar to an estimate from the 1990s. This result, along with robust cub production, suggests a stable and healthy population despite deteriorating sea ice conditions. Collectively, this and other recent on-land surveys provide a framework for implementing aerial surveys elsewhere. Although aerial surveys do not yield estimates of vital rates or population growth, they enable more rapid and frequent monitoring than mark-recapture. Integrating them in long-term monitoring programs will require consideration of ancillary data to infer status and facilitate setting harvest levels.},

    abstract = {Polar bears are of international conservation concern due to climate change but are difficult to study because of low densities and an expansive, circumpolar distribution. In a collaborative U.S.-Russian effort in spring of 2016, we used aerial surveys to detect and estimate the abundance of polar bears on sea ice in the Chukchi Sea. Our surveys used a combination of thermal imagery, digital photography, and human observations. Using spatio-temporal statistical models that related bear and track densities to physiographic and biological covariates (e.g., sea ice extent, resource selection functions derived from satellite tags), we predicted abundance and spatial distribution throughout our study area. Estimates of 2016 abundance (N ^ *) ranged from 3,435 (95% CI: 2,300-5,131) to 5,444 (95% CI: 3,636-8,152) depending on the proportion of bears assumed to be missed on the transect line during Russian surveys (g(0)). Our point estimates are larger than, but of similar magnitude to, a recent estimate for the period 2008-2016 (N ^ * = 2 , 937; 95% CI 1,522-5,944) derived from an integrated population model applied to a slightly smaller area. Although a number of factors (e.g., equipment issues, differing platforms, low sample sizes, size of the study area relative to sampling effort) required us to make a number of assumptions to generate estimates, it establishes a useful lower bound for abundance, and suggests high spring polar bear densities on sea ice in Russian waters south of Wrangell Island. With future improvements, we suggest that springtime aerial surveys may represent a plausible avenue for studying abundance and distribution of polar bears and their prey over large, remote areas.},
